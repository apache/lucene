The tools, documentation, etc. in this directory are intended to be helpful
to developers of Lucene and Solr.  They are not necessarily maintained in
the same way that the core code is maintained and so your mileage may vary
as to the usefulness of the tools.

Description of dev-tools/ contents:

./aws-jmh/       -- Scripts for running microbenchmarks across different ec2 instance types.
./doap/          -- Lucene project descriptors in DOAP RDF format.
./missing-doclet -- JavaDoc validation doclet subproject
./scripts/       -- Odds and ends for building releases, etc.
./test-patch/    -- Scripts for automatically validating patches
