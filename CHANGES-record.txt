This is a record of changes to the modernized gradle build.


* Instead of the "propertyOrDefault", an external
plugin for configuring various build options is now used:

https://github.com/carrotsearch/gradle-build-infra#plugin-comcarrotsearchgradlebuildinfrabuildoptionsbuildoptionsplugin

this plugin will source the given build option from several places, in
order:

- system property (-Dfoo=value),
- gradle property (-Pfoo=value),
- environment variable (foo=value ./gradlew ...)
- a *not versioned*, build-options.local.properties property file,
- a *versioned* build-options.properties property file.

It works much like before - you can override any build option
temporarily by passing, for example "-Ptests.verbose=true". But you
can also make such tweaks persistent (locally) by placing them
in your build-options.local.properties file.


The biggest gain from using this plugin is that you can now see
all options and their values, including their source (where their
value is defined). For example:

./gradlew :buildOptions


* Lucene's "base" version is now a build option. The default
value is in build-options.properties. You can override
any of 'version.suffix', 'version.base' or 'version.release'
using any of build option plugin's methods (see above).
