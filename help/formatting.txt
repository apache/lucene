Code formatting
===============

Starting with (LUCENE-9564) Java code is enforced to comply with
google-java-format conventions. In theory, you shouldn't worry about
what the convention actually looks like - write the code in any way
you like and then run:

./gradlew tidy

prior to running your regular precommit checks. This will reformat
your code so that it complies with the convention and passes gradle
'check' task.

IMPORTANT: There is *no* way to mark sections of the code as excluded
from formatting. This is by design and cannot be altered. In the vast
majority of cases the formatter will do a great job of cleaning up the
code. Occasionally you may want to rewrite the code (introduce a local
variable or reshape code paths) so that it's easier to read after
automatic formatting.

Gradle scripts
==============

Groovy and gradle code is also automatically formatted and this formatting
is enforced. This is unfortunately a heavy download and runtime-costly
application. If you'd like to temporarily skip this validation step, set
the lucene.spotlessGradleScripts option to false - either on command line
using -Plucene.spotlessGradleScripts=false, in your local
build-options.local.properties or by any other means build options can be
set.
