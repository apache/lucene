Distribution and artifact publishing
====================================


See all distribution-related tasks by running:
gradlew tasks --group distribution


Maven
-----

To publish Lucene Maven artifacts to a local ~/.m2 repository, run:

gradlew mavenToLocal

To publish Lucene Maven artifacts to Apache repositories
(CI or release manager's job, typically!), run:

gradlew mavenToApacheSnapshots -PasfNexusUsername= -PasfNexusPassword=
gradlew mavenToApacheReleases  -PasfNexusUsername= -PasfNexusPassword=

It is a good idea to avoid passing passwords on command line. CI jobs have
these properties saved in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties - this way they
are read automatically.

Apache Releases repository will not accept snapshots.


Release (distribution) artifacts
--------------------------------

Run:

gradlew assembleRelease

All distribution artifacts will be placed under:

lucene/distribution/build/release
