Publishing artifacts
====================


Maven
-----

To publish Lucene Maven artifacts to a local ~/.m2 repository, run:

gradlew mavenToLocal

To publish Lucene Maven artifacts to Apache Snapshots repository
(CI job, typically!), run:

gradlew mavenToApacheSnapshots -PasfNexusUsername= -PasfNexusPassword=

It is a good idea to avoid passing passwords on command line. CI jobs have
these properties saved in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties - this way they
are read automatically.
