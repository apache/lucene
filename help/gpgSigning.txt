GPG Signing
===========

Additional information on signing release artifacts with gpg (read publishing.txt first).

The following additional properties -- specified either on the command line via `-P...` or in your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` may be
useful/necessary in your system:

signing.gnupg.useLegacyGpg=true                    # Changes the default executable from `gpg2` to `gpg` and explicitly sets `--use-agent`
signing.gnupg.executable=gpg                       # Allows explicit control over what command executable used (ex: `gpg2`, `gpg`, `gpg.exe`, etc...)
signing.gnupg.homeDir=/tmp/gnupg-home              # overrides GnuPG's default home directory (ex: `~/.gnupg/`)
signing.gnupg.optionsFile=/tmp/gnupg-home/my.conf  # overrides GnuPG's default configuration file
signing.gnupg.passphrase=...                       # Provide your passphrase to gradle to hand off to gpg.  *NOT RECOMMENDED*, see below.


Notes About Error Messages
--------------------------


### `gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device`

This typically happens if your `gpg-agent` is configured (either globally for your operating system, or personally in your
`~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`) to use a `pinentry` command which depends on using the same `tty` as the `gpg` command (ex: `pinentry-curses`,
or `pinentry-tty`, etc...).

`tty` based `pinentry` implementations do not work when Gradle's `SigningPlugin` is attempting to invoke `gpg` -- among other problems:
Gradle is multi-threaded, and we sign multiple artifacts by default; so even if the `SigningPlugin` didn't automatically force `--no-tty` when
running `gpg` you could easily run into problems where a second `pinentry` process wanted to read from the same `tty` in the middle of you
typing in your passphrase to the first process.

Developers are encouraged to configure a *non* `tty` based `pinentry` (ex: `pinentry-gnome`, `pinentry-x11`, `pinentry-qt`, `pinentry-mac`,
`pinentry-wsl-ps1`, etc...) either globally in your operating system, or personally in your `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`, or in a new
`gpg-agent.conf` file a new GnuPG configuration directory (containing a copy of your private keys) that you direct gradle to via
`signing.gnupg.homeDir`

If none of these options are viable for you, then as a last resort you may wish to consider using the `signing.gnupg.passphrase=...` property.
This will expose your secret passphrase to the Gradle process, which will then pass it directly to each `gpg-agent` instance using
`--pinentry-mode=loopback`.


### `gpg: signing failed: No such file or directory`

This may mean that there is a problem preventing `gpg` from communicating correctly with the `gpg-agent` (and/or invoking your `pinentry`
program) that is independent of gradle.  Try running `pkill gpg-agent` and then retrying your `./gradlew` command


### `No value has been specified for property 'signatory.keyId'.`

Do not bother ever attempting to set a command line (or gradle.properties) property named `signatory.keyId`. This is evidently the
name of an internal property that the gradle `SigningPlugin` expects the `GnupgSignatory` plugin we use to provide -- which it does
as long as you have specified a valid value for `signing.gnupg.keyName`

If you see this error, it means you did not properly set `signing.gnupg.keyName` _AND_ you invoked a task which is attempting to use
the `SigningPlugin`, but does not depend on the custom `failUnlessGpgKeyProperty` to report the error correctly.  Please file a Jira
noting what `./gradlew` command you attempted to run so we can fix it's dependencies, and try again after setting `signing.gnupg.keyName`.
