Precommit Checks
================

Precommit checks are run by CI on your pull request.

To run checks before committing:

uvx prek

To install a precommit hook so this happens automatically:

uvx prek install

To exhaustively force-check all files (like CI does):

uvx prek --all-files

You need the uv package manager: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
