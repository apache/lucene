Local gradle settings
=====================

The first invocation of any task in Lucene's gradle build will generate
and save a project-local 'gradle.properties' file from a template,
with some default gradle JVM settings, which you can modify to your needs.

See your 'gradle.properties' file for more details of those settings.


Build options
=============

There are also various options that the Lucene build uses, which can affect
how tests are run or enable additional features (for example enable code
coverage or profiling).

To see the current values of all these options, run:

./gradlew allOptions

this prints all build options for all modules. You can print all options
for a single module too, for example:

./gradlew -p lucene/core buildOptions

The output of both tasks shows the options, their current values
and their current value's "source". All build option values can be
overridden by, in order of priority:

 * cli parameters to gradlew (system properties): -DoptionKey=value
 * cli parameters to gradlew (gradle properties): -PoptionKey=value
 * env variables: optionKey=value ./gradlew ...
 * property file (local for you, non-versioned!): build-options.local.properties
 * property file (versioned): build-options.properties

If you'd like to tweak some of the build options permanently, use the
build-options.local.properties file. For temporary overrides, use
cli parameters (preferably gradle parameters -Pxyz=value).
