IntelliJ IDEA
=============

Importing the project as a gradle project should just run out of the box.


Eclipse
=======

Run the following to set up Eclipse project files:

./gradlew eclipse

then import the project into Eclipse with:

File -> Import... -> Existing Project into Workspace

Please note that Eclipse does not distinguish between sub-projects
and package sets (main/ test) so pretty much all the sources and dependencies
are available in one large bin.


VSCode
======

Run the following to set up Eclipse project files:

./gradlew eclipse

Open the lucene checkout in VSCode.

GitHub Codespaces
=====

Fork the apache/lucene repository

Browse to https://github.com/codespaces/new

Repository: yourfork/lucene
Click "Create codespace"

Neovim
======

Run the following to set up Eclipse project files:

./gradlew eclipse

Install jdtls: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ls
Create lsp/jdtls.lua, see https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig for example.
Modify lsp/jdtls.lua to disable gradle/maven integration:

  init_options = {
    settings = {
      java = {
        import = {
          gradle = {
            enabled = false,
          },
          maven = {
            enabled = false,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },

Enable 'jdtls' language server with vim.lsp.enable()
