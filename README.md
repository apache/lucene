## Building

### Basic steps:

1. Install JDK 25 using your package manager or download manually from
[OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/),
[Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases),
[Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/),
[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or any other JDK provider.
2. Clone Lucene's git repository (or download the source distribution).
3. Run gradle launcher script (`gradlew`).

We'll assume that you know how to get and set up the JDK - if you don't, then we suggest starting at https://jdk.java.net/ and learning more about Java, before returning to this README.
