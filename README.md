written in Java.

[![Build Status](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Lucene/job/Lucene-Artifacts-main/badge/icon?subject=Lucene)](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Lucene/job/Lucene-Artifacts-main/)

## Online Documentation

This README file only contains basic setup instructions.  For more
comprehensive documentation, visit:

- Latest Releases: <https://lucene.apache.org/core/documentation.html>
- Nightly: <https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Lucene/job/Lucene-Artifacts-main/javadoc/>
- Build System Documentation: [help/](./help/)
- Developer Documentation: [dev-docs/](./dev-docs/)
- Migration Guide: [lucene/MIGRATE.md](./lucene/MIGRATE.md)

## Building

### Basic steps:
  
1. Install OpenJDK 17 or 18.
2. Clone Lucene's git repository (or download the source distribution).
3. Run gradle launcher script (`gradlew`).

We'll assume that you know how to get and set up the JDK - if you don't, then we suggest starting at https://jdk.java.net/ and learning more about Java, before returning to this README.
