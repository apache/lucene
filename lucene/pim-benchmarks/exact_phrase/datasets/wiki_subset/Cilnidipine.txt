<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Cilnidipine''' is a [[calcium channel blocker]]. Cilnidipine is approved for use in Japan, China, India, Korea, and some European countries to treat [[hypertension]]. 

<!-- Side effects and mechanisms -->
It is a calcium antagonist accompanied with [[L-type calcium channel|<small>L</small>-type]] and [[N-type calcium channel|<small>N</small>-type calcium channel]] blocking functions. Unlike other calcium antagonists, cilnidipine can act on the <small>N</small>-type calcium channel in addition to acting on the <small>L</small>-type calcium channel.

<!-- Society and culture -->
It was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1995.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=Jnos |last2=Ganellin |first2=C. Robin |title=Analogue-based Drug Discovery |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9783527607495 |page=466 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjKfqkaKkAAC&pg=PA466 |language=en}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
Cilnidipine decreases blood pressure and is used to treat hypertension and its [[Comorbidity|comorbidities]]. Due to its blocking action at the <small>N</small>-type and <small>L</small>-type calcium channel, cilnidipine dilates both [[arteriole]]s and [[venule]]s, reducing the pressure in the [[capillary bed]]. Cilnidipine is vasoselective and has a weak direct dromotropic effect, a strong vasodepressor effect, and an arrhythmia-inhibiting effect.
Blood pressure control with cilnidipine treatment in Japanese post-stroke hypertensive patients [The CA-ATTEND study] - the results of a large-scale prospective post-marketing surveillance study of post-stroke hypertensive patients (n = 2667, male 60.4%, 69.0 ± 10.9 years) treated with cilnidipine indicate that cilnidipine was effective in treating uncontrolled blood pressure and was well tolerated in post-stroke hypertensive patients.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/10641963.2016.1235183| pmid=28448181|title = Blood pressure control with cilnidipine treatment in Japanese post-stroke hypertensive patients: The CA-ATTEND study| journal=Clinical and Experimental Hypertension| volume=39| issue=3| pages=225–234|year = 2017|last1 = Aoki|first1 = Shiro| last2=Hosomi| first2=Naohisa| last3=Nezu| first3=Tomohisa| last4=Teshima| first4=Tsukasa| last5=Sugii| first5=Hitoshi| last6=Nagahama| first6=Shinobu| last7=Kurose| first7=Yoshiki| last8=Maruyama| first8=Hirofumi| last9=Matsumoto| first9=Masayasu| doi-access=free}}</ref>
The Ambulatory Blood Pressure Control and Home Blood Pressure (Morning and Evening) Lowering By N-Channel Blocker Cilnidipine (ACHIEVE-ONE) trial is a large-scale (n=2319) clinical study on blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) in the real world with use of cilnidipine - this study revealed that Cilnidipine significantly reduced BP and PR in hypertensive patients at the clinic and at home, especially with higher BP and PR in the morning.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Effects of the L / N‐Type Calcium Channel Blocker (Cilnidipine) on Sympathetic Hyperactive Morning Hypertension: Results From ACHIEVE‐ONE* |first1=Kazuomi |last1=Kario |first2=Shin‐ichi |last2=Ando |first3=Hidenori |last3=Kido|first4=Jin |last4=Nariyama |first5=Shin |last5=Takiuchi |first6=Tetsuo|last6=Yagi |first7=Toshiki|last7=Shimizu|first8=Kazuo|last8=Eguchi|first9=Minoru|last9=Ohno|first10=Osamu|last10=Kinoshita|first11=Takahisa|last11=Yamada|date=1 February 2013|journal=The Journal of Clinical Hypertension|volume=15|issue=2|pages = 133–142|doi=10.1111/jch.12042|pmid=23339732 }}</ref>

== Side effects ==
The side effects could be severe dizziness, fast heartbeat, and swelling of face, lips, tongue, eyelids, hands and feet. Lesser side effects include stomach pain, diarrhea and hypotension.

[[Peripheral edema]], a common side effect from the use of [[amlodipine]], was reduced when patients were shifted to cilnidipine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Minami|first1=Junichi|last2=Kawano|first2=Yuhei|last3=Makino|first3=Yuriko|last4=Matsuoka|first4=Hiroaki|last5=Takishita|first5=Shuichi|date=2017-05-01|title=Effects of cilnidipine, a novel dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on autonomic function, ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate in patients with essential hypertension|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=615–620|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2125.2000.00299.x|issn=0306-5251|pmc=2015014|pmid=11136301}}</ref>

==History==
It was jointly developed by [[Fuji Viscera Pharmaceutical Company]] and [[Ajinomoto]],<nowiki/> and was approved to enter the market and be used as an [[anti-hypertensive]] in 1995.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
