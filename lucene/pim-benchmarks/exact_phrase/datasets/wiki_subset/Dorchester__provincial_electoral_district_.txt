'''Dorchester''' was a provincial electoral district in the [[Chaudière-Appalaches]] region of the province of [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].

Its final election was in [[1970 Quebec general election|1970]].  It disappeared in the [[1973 Quebec general election|1973 election]] and its successor electoral districts were [[Bellechasse (provincial electoral district)|Bellechasse]], [[Beauce-Nord (provincial electoral district)|Beauce-Nord]], and [[Beauce-Sud]].
