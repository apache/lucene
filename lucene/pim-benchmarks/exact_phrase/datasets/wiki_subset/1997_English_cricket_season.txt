The '''1997 cricket season''' was the 98th in which the [[County Championship]] has been an official competition. The season centred on the [[Test cricket|six-Test]] [[Australian cricket team in England in 1997|Ashes series]] against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]. [[England cricket team|England]] won the first, at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]], by the decisive margin of [[the result in cricket|nine wickets]], and the rain-affected second Test at [[Lord's]] was drawn, but any English optimism was short-lived. Australia won the next three games by huge margins to secure the series and retain [[The Ashes]], and England's three-day victory in the final game at [[The Oval]] was little more than a consolation prize. It was the 68th test series between the two sides with Australia finally winning 3-2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997/AUS_IN_ENG/|title=Ashes on CricInfo|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo}}</ref> The three-match [[One Day International|ODI]] series which preceded the Tests produced a statistical curiosity, with England winning each match by an identical margin, six wickets.

The Britannic Assurance [[County Championship]] went to [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] for the first time since [[1969 English cricket season|1969]], by a margin of just four points from [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]]. The combination of captain [[Matthew Maynard]] and [[Steve James (cricketer)|Steve James]]' batting and [[Waqar Younis]]' and [[Steve Watkin]]'s bowling propelled them to the title, although the matter was not settled until the final match of the season, when Glamorgan's maximum-points thrashing of [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] at [[County Ground, Taunton|Taunton]] ensured that Kent's own victory over [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] was irrelevant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Engel|first=Matthew|title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2004, pages 493-494|year=2004|publisher=John Wisden & Company Ltd|isbn=0-947766-83-9}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=oxfshlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=IF502232946&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=Alan Lee Cricket Correspondent. "Glamorgan prove value of team ethic." Times [London, England] 22 Sept. 1997|publisher=The Times Digital Archive}}</ref> 

In [[one-day cricket]], [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] won the [[National League (cricket)|AXA Life League]] by two points from [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], but were themselves thrashed by nine wickets by [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in the final of the [[NatWest Trophy]]. The honours in the [[Benson & Hedges Cup]] went to [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], who beat Kent by eight wickets in the final.

[[Ali Brown]]'s 203 for Surrey in the AXA Life League against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in July remains the only double century ever scored in a 40-over [[List A cricket|List A]] match.
