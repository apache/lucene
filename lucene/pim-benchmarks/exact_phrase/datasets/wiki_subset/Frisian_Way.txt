The '''Frisian Way''' ({{lang-de|Friesische Straße}}) was a medieval [[trade route]] and [[Reichsstraße (Middle Ages)|imperial road]] in the northwest of Germany. It had a length of about 220&nbsp;km and linked the town of [[Norden (Ostfriesland)|Norden]] in [[East Frisia]] with [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]] in [[Westphalia]].

== Course ==
The Frisian Way ran from Norden to Emden roughly along the line of the present day federal roads, the [[Bundesstraße 72|B 72]] and [[Bundesstraße 210|B 210]]. From Emden it ran approximately along the route of the [[Bundesautobahn 31|B 31]] to Leer. In Leer it crossed the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] and then ran southwards roughly parallel to the Ems on its left bank to Münster. It followed the approximate course of the [[Bundesstraße 436|B 436]] (Leer - Weener), the [[Landesstraße|L 31]] (Weener - Rhede), [[Kreisstraße|K 155]] (Rhede - Heede) and 156 (Heede), L 48 (Heede - Altenlingen), K 34 (Nordlohne - Schepsdorf), L 40 (Elbergen - Emsbüren), K 327 (Emsbüren - Salzbergen), L 39 (Salzbergen - Lower Saxony/North Rhine-Westphalia state border) and 501 (state border - Rheine), the federal roads of the [[Bundesstraße 481|B 481]] (Rheine - Emsdetten) and [[Bundesstraße 219|B 219]] (Sprakel - Münster).

== Junctions with other roads ==
From Leer there was an eastern road to [[Oldenburg (Oldenburg)|Oldenburg]] that continued to [[Bremen]]. In Weener a road branched off west to [[Winschoten]] and from there to [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. From [[Rhede]] there was a junction with an easterly road to [[Aschendorf (Ems)|Aschendorf]] which continued via the [[geest (topography)|geest]] ridges of the [[Hümmling]] to [[Haselünne]] to the Flemish Way ([[Lübeck]] - [[Brügge]]). South of [[Heede (Emsland)|Heede]] another road from Winschoten to the trade route of the Hümmling crossed the Frisian Way. West of Meppen another road branches off to Haselünne. Southwest of Lingen the Flemish Way crosses the Frisian Way. In Rheine there were other roads running to [[Osnabrück]] and [[Enschede]]. In Münster there were links to [[Cologne]] (the Cologne Way), [[Coesfeld]] (the Coesfeld Way), [[Gronau (Westf.)|Gronau]] (Horstmar Land Way) and via  [[Warendorf]] to [[Paderborn]] (Hesse Way).

== Towns along the Frisian Way ==
[[Norden (Ostfriesland)|Norden]] - [[Emden]] - [[Leer (Ostfriesland)|Leer]] - [[Weener]] - [[Haren (Ems)|Haren]] - [[Meppen]] - [[Lingen (Ems)|Lingen]] - [[Rheine]] - [[Emsdetten]] - [[Greven]] - [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]]
