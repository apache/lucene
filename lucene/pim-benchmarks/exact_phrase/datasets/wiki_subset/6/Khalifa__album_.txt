==Background==
On January 10, 2016, Wiz Khalifa announced the title to his new project: ''Khalifa''. Khalifa also explained that the project would largely consist of older unreleased songs that were recorded for his previous albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://djbooth.net/features/2018-01-03-id-labs-producer-e-dan-responds|title=ID Labs producer responds to DJ Booth about Atlantic Records unfairly compensating producers|publisher=DJ Booth|accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/wiz-khalifa-announces-khalifa-release-date-news.19555.html |title=Wiz Khalifa Announces "Khalifa" Release Date |publisher=hotnewhiphop|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}</ref> No physical copies of the project were made.

==Singles==
The project's lead [[Single (music)|single]], "[[Bake Sale (song)|Bake Sale]]", was released for purchase and streaming on January 21, 2016.<ref name="iTunes">{{cite web|url= https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/khalifa/id1077051655 |title= Khalifa by Wiz Khalifa on iTunes |publisher= iTunes |date= January 24, 2016}}</ref> The song features a [[guest appearance]] from American rapper [[Travis Scott]], while the production was provided by [[TM88]], Juicy J, [[Lex Luger (producer)|Lex Luger]], DJ Spinz and Crazy Mike. In December 2015, Wiz Khalifa previewed that track and then announced that the song would be included on his new project, ''Khalifa''.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://twitter.com/wizkhalifa/status/680964524069883904 |title= Yes.

Upon its release, ''Khalifa'' was met with generally mixed reviews from [[music critic]]s. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 56, which indicates "mixed or average reviews", based on 7 reviews.<ref name="metacritic1"/> Chris Gibbons of ''Exclaim!'' said, "''Khalifa'' likely won't sway opinion of Wiz Khalifa, whether positive or negative. For better or worse, it's a portrait of the rapper we've seen for years. It does do things a little more consistently and adds a little more detail than what we're used to seeing."<ref name="exclaim1">{{cite web|last=Fox |first=Luke |url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/HipHop/wiz_khalifa-blacc_hollywood |title=Wiz Khalifa – Blacc Hollywood |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=2014-08-15 |accessdate=2014-08-20}}</ref> Kris Ex of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said, "On ''Khalifa'', he's characteristically mellow and melodic, mixing rhymes that are part equal parts braggadocio and motivational slogans in an almost singular pursuit of highs and riches. By design, none of the songs stand out, save for the Travis Scott featuring 'Bake Sale', which wins mostly by sounding like an aired-out version of Scott's own hit '[[Antidote (Travis Scott song)|Antidote]]'."<ref name="Billboard" /> David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] questioned the exclusion of "[[See You Again (Wiz Khalifa song)|See You Again]]" and said, "These expansive cuts surely benefit the Wiz discography, and will do best when shuffled into his canon, but lump them together into one LP and take away the driving influence and Khalifa feels more like part of a continuum than a self-contained statement."<ref name="allmusic1"/>

''Khalifa'' debuted at number six on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 64,000 [[album-equivalent units]]; it sold 45,000 copies in its first week, boasting over 19.8 million streams.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hip Hop Album Sales: Future, Wiz Khalifa & Young Thug|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.37489/title.hip-hop-album-sales-future-wiz-khalifa-young-thug|work=Hip Hop DX|date=February 15, 2016}}</ref> ''Khalifa'' became Khalifa's fourth consecutive top-ten debut on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="firstweek">{{cite news|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|title=Future Scores Third No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6875223/future-evol-billboard-200-no-1|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 14, 2016|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref>
