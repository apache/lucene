'''Dorothy Watson Glisson''' (May 10, 1912 â€“ April 10, 2001) was the 17th [[Secretary of State of Florida]], serving for six months from 1974 to 1975. She was the first woman to hold a [[Florida Cabinet]] post.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/29891|title=Portrait of Secretary of State Mrs. Dorothy W.

Glisson began working in the state elections office in 1951, and became head of the office in 1954. She served in that role for 20 years until July 1974, when Governor [[Reubin Askew]] appointed her to fill out the term of Secretary of State [[Richard Stone (politician)|Richard Stone]]. Stone had resigned to focus on campaigning for the U.S. Senate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nZceAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tswEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2728%2C2843390|title=Dorothy Has a Mind of Her Own|last=Mueller|first=John|date=June 23, 1974|work=Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal|access-date=June 19, 2016|via=}}</ref>

Glisson did not intend to run for election in 1974, but rather complete the sixth months remaining in Stone's unexpired term. After her elected successor [[Bruce Smathers]] was inaugurated in January 1975, Glisson returned to her previous position as director of the Division of Elections. In January 1976, Askew appointed her secretary of the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jAEkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KmcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6037%2C6271738|title=Mrs. Glisson Gets New Appointment|last=AP|first=|date=December 13, 1975|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|access-date=|via=}}</ref> She served in that role until July 1978, when she returned to the Department of State as an assistant secretary under [[Jesse J.
