*'''Delete''' - Doesn't pass NHOCKEY and I have not found any non-trivial coverage to meet GNG. [[User:Rlendog|Rlendog]] ([[User talk:Rlendog|talk]]) 13:56, 27 June 2016 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' No significant independent coverage to meet the GNG and doesn't meet the hockey notability criteria.[[User:Mdtemp|Mdtemp]] ([[User talk:Mdtemp|talk]]) 14:19, 28 June 2016 (UTC)
