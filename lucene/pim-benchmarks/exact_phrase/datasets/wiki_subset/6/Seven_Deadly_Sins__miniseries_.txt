'''''Seven Deadly Sins''''' is an Australian 7-part [[anthology series]] examining the dark side of human nature in seven episodes: "Lust", "Pride", "Wrath", "Sloth", "Greed", "Envy" and "Gluttony" – the [[seven deadly sins]].

==Production==
''Seven Deadly Sins'' was pitched to [[Penny Chapman]], then head of drama at the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], by script editor Barbara Masel. Her idea was to create a series of stories that would "let the moral compass spin".<ref name=austlit /> Masel was also interested in encouraging the audience to identify with behaviour they would not normally condone and "that all of the characters in each of the episodes should manifest the sin".<ref name=austlit /> With Chapman on board and Bob Weis appointed as series producer, Masel then set about finding writers. When outlines and drafts were completed, the directors were brought on board. [[P. J. Hogan]] ("Sloth") and [[Alison Maclean]] ("Greed") were selected as directors before their international careers had taken off, while [[Gale Edwards]] ("Pride") had until then had only ever directed for the theatre. The series was broadcast at 9.30pm because of the language used. The series rated well, pulling the biggest audience ever at the time for an ABC drama program in that time slot.<ref name=austlit>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/C693841|title=''The Seven Deadly Sins'' series |publisher=austlit|accessdate=18 June 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref>
