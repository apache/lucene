'''Gaius Julius Iulus''' was a member of the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Julia (gens)|gens Julia]], and was nominated [[Roman dictator|dictator]] in 352 BC.<ref name="DGRBM">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 657.</ref>

==Family==
The Julii Iuli were the oldest branch of the ancient [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] Julia gens, and their [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]] span nearly a century and a half leading to Gaius' dictatorship.  However, only one other member of the family is recorded following the [[Battle of the Allia|sack of Rome]] by the [[Gauls]] in 390 BC: [[Lucius Julius Iulus (consular tribune 388 BC)|Lucius Julius Iulus]], who was [[tribuni militum consulari potestate|consular tribune]] in 388, and again in 379.<ref name="DGRBM"/>  As Gaius' [[Roman naming conventions#filiation|filiation]] has not been preserved, it is uncertain whether he was the son of this Lucius, or perhaps one of his predecessors, such as the [[Lucius Julius Iulus (consular tribune 401 BC)|Lucius]] who was consular tribune in 401 and 397, or the [[Lucius Julius Iulus (consular tribune 403 BC)|Lucius]] who was consular tribune in 403, or the [[Gaius Julius Iulus (consular tribune 408 BC)|Gaius Julius Iulus]] who was consular tribune in 408 and 405, and [[Roman censor|censor]] in BC 393.  In any case, he is the last of the Julii Iuli known to have held any magistracy.  Whether the family ended with him, or continued on in obscurity, or perhaps under a different [[cognomen]], is similarly unknown.<ref name="DGRBM"/>

==Career==
Gaius was nominated dictator some fifteen years after the passage of the ''[[lex Licinia Sextia]]'', the law which opened the [[Roman consul|consulship]] to the [[plebs|plebeians]], by requiring that one of the consuls should be a plebeian.  But in the years that followed, the patricians had made every effort to skirt the law, and elect two patricians.  Both consuls had been patricians in 355, 354, and 353 BC, and the patricians were determined to elect two of their number once more for 352.<ref name="Broughton 124">Broughton, vol. I, pp. 124â€“127.</ref>

The [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunes of the plebs]] blocked the elections from being held until the [[Roman Senate|senate]] agreed to put forward candidates in accordance with the Licinian law.  Meanwhile, the dictator, [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (consul 347 BC)|Titus Manlius Torquatus]], would not permit the elections to be held if plebeian candidates were allowed; thus, the elections could not be held until after the dictator's term of office had expired, and even then an [[interrex]] had to be appointed, as the senate and the tribunes could not agree to the terms.  Under Roman law, the interrex was required to resign his office after five days, and another was appointed; then another, and another, until eleven interreges had been appointed.<ref>Livy, vii. 21.</ref><ref name="Broughton 124"/>

Faced with growing unrest, the senate finally directed the interrex Lucius Cornelius Scipio to observe the Licinian law.  As a result, a plebeian, [[Gaius Marcius Rutilus]], who had previously held the consulship in BC 357, was elected alongside the patrician Publius Valerius Poplicola.  Vexed by their defeat, the patricians resolved to defy the law once more in the elections for 351, and they nominated Gaius Julius Iulus dictator, on the pretext that twelve [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] cities had formed an alliance to oppose Rome.  As his [[magister equitum]], Julius nominated Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus.<ref name="Livy vii 22">Livy, vii. 22.</ref><ref name="DGRBM"/><ref name="Broughton 124"/>

It soon became apparent that there was no impending hostility from Etruria, as the rumor of an alliance had been false.  The dictator was unable to secure the election of two patrician candidates, but the patricians were not yet ready to accept defeat.  Following Julius' resignation, [[Gaius Sulpicius Peticus]] was appointed interrex; he too failed to procure the desired result, but his successor, Marcus Fabius Ambustus, succeeded, and two patricians were elected in violation of the Licinian law.<ref name="Livy vii 22"/><ref name="Broughton 124"/>
