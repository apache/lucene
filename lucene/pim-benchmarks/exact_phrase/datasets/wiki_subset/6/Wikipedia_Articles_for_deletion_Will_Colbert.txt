* '''Keep'''. This article appears to meet [[WP:NHOCKEY]] which states "''Ice hockey players are presumed notable if they: 1. Played one or more games in an existing or defunct top professional league''". The article and references indicate that during the 2012–13 season he played 33 games with the [[Belfast Giants]] of the [[Elite Ice Hockey League]], which per the league article is "''the highest level of ice hockey competition in the United Kingdom''". Also, during the 2013–14 season he played 35 games with the [[Tilburg Trappers]] of the [[Eredivisie]], which per the league article is "''the only professional ice hockey league in the Netherlands and the highest level of competition organized by the [[Nederlandse IJshockey Bond]] (Dutch Ice Hockey Federation)''". If I am mistaken please let me know. Thanks. -- [[User:Zyxw|Zyxw]] ([[User talk:Zyxw|talk]]) 11:38, 19 June 2016 (UTC)
::Yes, you are mistaken. According to [[WP:NHOCKEY/LA]] both the EIHL and Eredivisie are considered "lower-level leagues" "for the purpose of satisfying Criterion #4." Criterion #4 is "achieved preeminent honors." [[User:Joeykai|Joeykai]] ([[User talk:Joeykai|talk]]) 13:28, 19 June 2016 (UTC)
* '''Delete'''. Joeykai is correct that [[WP:NHOCKEY/LA]] specifies that both of the leagues involved here are considered ''lower-level'' leagues that can get some players over NHOCKEY point #4, but do ''not'' give ''all'' their players an automatic #1 pass the way the NHL does. And nothing claimed here fulfills #4. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 19:17, 20 June 2016 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' According to his Eliteprospects profile he won the award for best defenseman in the Eredivisie the one year he played.  That would seem to me to meet the requirement of criterion 4 as achieving a preeminent honor.  Even in a narrow interpretation of preeminent honor, the best defenseman is equivelant to being a first team all-star that is listed (actually better since presumably there are two all-star defenseman and he is number one).  Therefore we can presume sources exist - I would presume they are in Dutch so will be hard to find, but we should presume they exist and that we should keep.

*'''Keep''' - I agree with RonSigPi that being named Top Defenseman in the league is functionally equivalent (at least) to being a first team all-star, and so he meets criterion #4 of [[WP:NHOCKEY]]. [[User:Rlendog|Rlendog]] ([[User talk:Rlendog|talk]]) 13:37, 27 June 2016 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per RonSigPi's reasoning and arguments. I agree that Colbert certainly appears to meet the spirit, if not the letter of [[WP:NHOCKEY]] Criteria #4. [[User:Ejgreen77|Ejgreen77]] ([[User talk:Ejgreen77|talk]]) 17:31, 3 July 2016 (UTC)
