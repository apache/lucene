The '''World Confessional Lutheran Association''' was established in 1965 by a group of pastors and lay people who were concerned about trends in the [[American Lutheran Church]] and other synods which were contrary to what they believed were the historical beliefs and practice of Lutheranism.

In 1980 through the involvement of Lutherans Alert National the group was renamed '''Conservative Lutheran Association''' (CLA)..<ref name=ARDA>{{cite web|title=Conservative Lutheran Association|url=http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1295.asp|work=American Denomination Profiles|publisher=[[Association of Religion Data Archives]]|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Trinity">{{cite web|title=The CLA|url=http://www.tlcanaheim.com/cla|publisher=Trinity Lutheran Church and Christian School|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref> It has 994 baptized members<ref>[http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf LWF Statistics 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604203414/http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf |date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref> and is a member of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf |title=A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America |access-date=2010-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121161735/http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
