The '''San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club''' (SFBACC) is a non-profit corporation serving the needs for the play and development of the sport of [[curling]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and its surrounding outskirts. Headquartered in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], it is the largest curling club in California as well as in the [[Mountain Pacific Curling Association]].

The San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club is a registered non-profit corporation in the state of California. The SFBACC is a member of the [[Mountain Pacific Curling Association]] and also of the [[United States Curling Association]].

== History ==

The San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club (SFBACC) was founded March 13, 1958 in [[Mountain View, California]]. In the club's early years, it had a dedicated curling facility called the Peninsula Curling Rink.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |publisher=San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club |url=http://www.bayareacurling.com/club-history |accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref> By the early 1970's the dedicated facility was closed and the club was curling on [[Arena curling|arena]] ice. 

Starting in 1994 the SFBACC began curling at Solar4America Ice at San Jose, renting ice for short seasons until 2006 when regular league times were established. Also in 2006 the club expanded to nearby [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] to begin curling at Solar4America Ice at Fremont. With interest in the sport continuing to grow throughout the San Francisco Bay Area the club expanded again in the summer of 2009 to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].

From 2009 to 2018 the club conducted activities at the three separate locations in San Jose, Fremont, and Oakland. In early 2018 the SFBACC allowed the newly formed Silicon Valley Curling Club (SVCC) to take over all curling activities at Solar4America at San Jose and Solar4America at Fremont.  

==Current Facilities==
As of 2019, the club currently does not have any curling facilities. 

=== Dedicated Curling Facility ===
In September 2017 the SFBACC announced they had signed a lease agreement for a building in Oakland with the intention of building California's only dedicated curling center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bayareacurling.com/content/sfbacc-dedicated-curling-center|title=FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: SF BAY AREA CURLING CLUB TO BUILD STATE'S ONLY DEDICATED CURLING CENTER {{!}} San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club|website=www.bayareacurling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dedicatedice.com/|title=SF Bay Area Curling - Dedicated Ice Fundraising|website=San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club {{!}} Dedicated Ice|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref> The facility will have five curling sheets and was originally expected to open in the summer of 2019, but as of December 2019 has not yet opened. The club currently anticipates an opening date in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dedicated Ice Facility|url=http://www.bayareacurling.com/node/711}}</ref>

=== Oakland Ice Center ===
Prior to 2018, the SFBACC curled at [http://www.oaklandice.com/ Oakland Ice Center], located in the city's [[Uptown Oakland|Uptown district]]. The rink is owned by the city of Oakland and operated by Sharks Ice, LLC. As of December 2019, the club's affiliation with the Oakland Ice Center had ended.

== Events ==

The SFBACC has hosted the Golden Gate [[Bonspiel]] annually each spring during [[Memorial Day]] weekend since 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://goldengatebonspiel.com/|title=Golden Gate Bonspiel 2018 {{!}} Golden Gate Bonspiel|website=goldengatebonspiel.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref> The tournament is held at Solar4America Ice at Fremont. 

The club teaches Learn-to-Curl events throughout the year to expose new people to the sport. During the [[Winter Olympic Games]] interest is especially high and so the club hosts numerous Learn-to-Curl events, lesson series, and instructional leagues to teach thousands of people. 

In October 2013 the SFBACC played host to the [[World Curling Federation]] Olympic Celebration Tour, which brought 2010 Olympic silver medalist [[Carolyn McRorie]] to Oakland to participate in multiple clinics.
