*'''Redirect''' to a new article: [[List of middle schools in Fairfax County, Virginia]] which seems like a better way to handle coverage of middle schools in this district unless the articles can meet [[WP:N]]. I invite anyone with an interest to edit the new article. It seems to me that all or nearly all of these middle school articles could, with enough research, meet Wikipedia notability standards when some editor has the interest and ability to do the research. I would change to "Keep" if sourcing is provided for this article, as per [[WP:HEY]] [[User:Noroton|Noroton]] ([[User talk:Noroton|talk]]) 02:47, 13 December 2007 (UTC)
