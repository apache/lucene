===[[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cenarium|Cenarium]]===
'''FINAL (42/2/2); ended 21:00, 19 June 2008 (UTC)'''

{{User|Cenarium}} - I was recently working in [[:C:CSD|speedy deletions]] when I came across a set of 4 [[WP:CSD#G7|author request]] pages from [[User:Cenarium]].  I thought it was rather strange that an admin was not just simply deleting these himself.  I went to his talk page, and to my surprise, found that Cenarium was not in fact an administrator as I had always assumed.  Time to change that.  Cenarium has been a prolific editor for the last 6 months, but he is hard to pin down because he has been impressive in many areas as an editor.  On one hand, he has shown his technical abilities in Math related fields, and has created several Portals for the [[WP:WPM|math Wikiproject]].  For example, see [[Portal:Set theory|this]] or [[Portal:Number theory|this]] (there are others that can be linked to from [[User:Cenarium/contributions|here]]).  But Cenarium does more than that.  After studying his contributions, it is quite apparent that he knows exactly the purpose of the encyclopedia.  ''Content''.  He has started articles, yes. (see [[User:Cenarium/contributions|contribs list]]).  Cenarium knows how to build this place, and then once built, and equally important in an administrative candidate, knows quite well how to protect its integrity and accuracy.  He has excellent, policy based experience in [[WP:AFD]] and [[WP:MFD]], as well as fighting vandalism.  Of Cenarium's 8000+ edits, only 1/8th are using automated tools, showing that he knows when and how to use them, but does not get carried away.  Recently, he even went so far as to create an [[User:Muiranec|alternate account]] so as not to clog his contrib list with Huggle edits and skew his numbers artificially high.  Even there, his Huggle use is extremely solid and "done the right way."  I could go on and on - clean block log, 100% edit summary usage, civil at all times, patient, informed and informative, organized, vast levels of [[WP:CLUE]], and communicative.  He knows when he's right, and he knows when he's wrong.  He knows how to debate without arguing, and how to discuss without attacking - excellent qualities in an administrator.  He absolutely blows [[User:Keeper76/RfA|my criteria for adminship]] away.  Time to give him the mop, which I'm confident he will use wisely, proficiently, and appropriately.

====Questions for the candidate====
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia as an administrator. It is recommended that you answer these optional questions to provide guidance for participants:
:'''1.''' What admin work do you intend to take part in?
::'''A:''' I plan to work initially in areas where I'm already experienced. I've a good experience in deletion debates, as !voter and also non-admin closer, so I intend to work at [[WP:AFD]] and other [[WP:XFD]]s. I made a good deal of speedy deletion nominations during my time here, so I intend to work at [[:C:CSD]] too. I also regularly revert vandalism, warn and report when needed, so I intend to check [[WP:AIV]] on a regular basis. I'm also familiar with page moves-related matters, so I'd like to help at [[WP:RM]] and [[WP:SPLICE]]. For a while now, I've been watching and joined discussions at [[WP:ANI]] and [[WP:AN]], so I plan to help there in a regular manner, and more generally wherever administrative assistance is needed.

:'''2.''' What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?
::'''A:''' My best contributions are my content addition, the articles I created and four portals I made on subjects I like, they are listed [[User:Cenarium/contributions|here]]. I'm not a great article writer, but I frequently try to improve some stubs when I feel that I can help, for example [[Halyzia sedecimguttata]]. I particularly appreciate when I help to save an article from deletion in improving it and addressing the issues raised, this happened for [[viral email]]. These contributions will last, I can see the result of my efforts and this is gratifying. But most of my work is centred on maintenance or related to vandalism, this is capital for Wikipedia and I value these contributions too.

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
::'''A:''' I've not participated in a major content dispute until now. On several occasions however, I've been involved in debates a little more heated than usual. But I always try to act with detachment, know what I'm talking about and focus on the content. I've been involved in the [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Great Cabal Debate|great cabal debate]], which calmed down well since. It was my first encounter with a [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Cabals|RfC]] and the only one for now. I've also participated to a debate over the [[WP:TFA|TFA]] process, [[Wikipedia_talk:TFA#Stricter_standards|here]]. No user has caused me stress, I don't take things personally, but in the same time, I don't hesitate to comment as neutrally as possible when I feel the need, and in a constructive manner. I also have the habit to review my contributions and reconsider my positions. I think I'm going to keep up like this and take the benefit of criticism.
<!-- ''''Additional questions from [[User:Example|Example]]:''' -->
'''Optional question from Keepscases'''
:'''4.''' Do you believe that I PUT THE P IN WIKIPEDIA is an appropriate user name?
::'''A.''' I'd say that the appropriateness of the username needs to be discussed. As an administrator, I would not block the user "on sight", as I don't think that it meets the criteria for an immediate block of the [[WP:U|username policy]] (but I may miss something in the username) and I prefer to be careful with this. If it were a report at [[WP:UAA]], I would ask the reporter to explain why it needs to be blocked immediately, depending on the initial rationale, and to discuss with the user. I may also seek other opinions, and ultimately, if the situation requires it, I would direct to [[WP:RFCN]].

#::::You're right.

#:::::::Some people are familiar enough with a nom that they know they would not nominate an unworthy candidate. Keeper is a fairly thorough vetting procedure. If he didn't find anything troubling or out of the ordinary, it's unlikely that I will either.

#::::::::I have no desire to make a big fuss here, and I certainly don't want to distract from this candidate and his RfA.  But I would remind those who contribute to RfA to do a little research of their own.  This is not at all to deny that there are some very good nominators out there, and I agree that Keeper is a particularly good one.

=====Oppose=====
#Was not impressed with his participation in the [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Cabals|Cabals RfC]] or the proposed [[Wikipedia_talk:TFA#Stricter_standards|TFA shakeup]]. I feel a lot of candidate's comments are a bit too close to policy wonkery for comfort—[[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Cabals#View_by_Cenarium|''...groups working on a specific topic of the encyclopedia should be allowed as long as they ... clearly explain their goals to improve mainspace content, how they differentiate from wikiprojects and don't break other policies or guidelines...'']] is frankly ridiculous. Combine this with no significant content contribution (as opposed to mostly thoughtless maintenance or anti-vandal work) is concerning.

#:It doesn't seem overly worrying to me. I frankly don't see anything wrong with the first, though perhaps a [[WP:TL;DR|little too wordy]], and the second just seems like the comments of someone who's not familiar with FAC. I generally don't support candidates without significant mainspace contributions, but Cenarium seemed like an extremely good candidate otherwise, so I took a liberty.

#::Heya, thanks for replying... obviously we disagree on this case but that's OK. My bug with the RfC commentary was that it feels (to me) like he'd put barriers in the way of encyclopedia building, for process sake. (I should write an essay about how [[WP:PII|process isn't inherently important, it's just useful when it helps build articles]] at some stage.) That's a bad thing, and administrators are more able to do that (using teh powerz granted). #:For now I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

#:::I admit that I didn't handle the cabal RFC very well, probably due to my inexperience. I've never really be satisfied with this comment. I'm not a fan of process, I prefer to use common sense and analyze case by case. That's why I didn't support the [[User talk:Master of Puppets/Cabal policy|cabal policy]]. That was not my intention to put barriers in the way of encyclopedia building, and I would call for [[WP:IAR|IAR]] if I feel this is needed. For example, when a user remove a speedy deletion tag from an article he/she created which blatantly doesn't qualify as a speedy-deletion candidate, I would endorse the removal, for example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=215628735 here] (the second comment, whose end was intended to be humorous). But I share some of your thoughts on my editing, and I hope I'll be able to increase the significance of my mainspace contributions in the future (I'm [[ESL]] type.). <strong><span style="font-family:Monotype;">[[User:Cenarium|<font color="#000080">Cena</font><font color="#1560bd">rium</font>]][[User_talk:Cenarium|<font color="#000090"> '''(talk)'''</font>]]</span></strong> 13:16, 13 June 2008 (UTC)
#::::Hey, no probs with being ESL - I am [[Romanian language|too]] (though probably not to the same extent). ''[[user:giggy|giggy]]'' <sub>([[user talk:giggy|:O]])</sub> 13:51, 13 June 2008 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' Mainly per giggy's concerns, and having seen him a lot at MfD, I get the impression he beleives some of our policies to be ''prescriptive'' rather than ''descriptive''.

=====Neutral=====
#'''Neutral''' per giggy, though I don't feel strongly enough about the issues raised to oppose. --[[User:Jbmurray|jbmurray]] ([[User talk:Jbmurray|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jbmurray|contribs]]) 10:25, 14 June 2008 (UTC)
#'''Neutral''' per giggy, plus I also get the impression that the candidate needs to work on the "people interaction" thing (not just communication); that aspect of sysop work that is sometimes being the bridge between the editor and the encyclopedia. I don't think the candidate would abuse the tools, but perhaps hasn't had the wider experience to use them well.
