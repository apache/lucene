Delete as nonnotable. This is a BLP that has been tagged as unsourced since October 2007. I have found a modest amount of information about the article subject at http://www.yaconn.org/artists/study-guides/StudyGuide-LittleBrother.pdf and other pages on the http://www.yaconn.org/ website, but nothing I found indicates to me that Mr. Singleton has received sufficient attention as a theatre professional to be deemed notable.
