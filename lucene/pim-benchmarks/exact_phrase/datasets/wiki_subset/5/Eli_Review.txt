'''Eli Review''' is a web-based service that provides instructors with tools to facilitate [[peer learning]] through the three primary activities in the [[writing process]]: writing, review, and revision. Its main theoretical basis is a concept associated with [[Lev Vygotsky]] known as the [[zone of proximal development]], or [[instructional scaffolding]], where learners build confidence and skill through working with a more capable peer and with the guidance of an experienced teacher or mentor. It was originally developed at [[Michigan State University]], and functioned for several years in the MSU community before commercialisation in 2011.

Eli Review positions instructors as “review coordinators” where they design survey-like reviews that guide students in giving criteria-based feedback. This allows assignment and review of writing and revision tasks to be performed piecemeal, which enables students to develop work iteratively and focus more on higher-order concerns such as organization and pairing claims with suitable evidence, than surface-level issues such as grammar or spelling.  Engagement data is tracked for individual activities and automatically compiled into individual student and aggregate class reports.
