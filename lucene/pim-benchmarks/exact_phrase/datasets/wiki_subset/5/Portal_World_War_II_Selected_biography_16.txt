  |text= '''[[Helmut Lent]]''' (13 June 1918 â€“ 7 October 1944) was a German [[night fighter]] ace in [[World War&nbsp;II]] who shot down 110 [[aircraft]], 103 of them at night. Lent claimed his first aerial victories at the outset of World War&nbsp;II in the [[invasion of Poland]] and over the [[German Bight]]. During the [[Norwegian Campaign|invasion of Norway]] he flew ground support missions before he was transferred to the newly established [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1]] (NJG&nbsp;1), a night fighter wing. Lent claimed his first nocturnal aerial victory on 12 May 1941 and on 30 August 1941 was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. His steady accumulation of aerial victories resulted in regular promotions and awards. On the night of 15 June 1944, [[Major (Germany)|Major]] Lent was the first night fighter pilot to claim 100 nocturnal aerial victories, a feat which earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] on 31 July 1944. On 5 October 1944, Lent flew a [[Junkers Ju&nbsp;88]] on a routine transit flight from [[Stade]] to [[Borchen|Nordborchen]], {{convert|5|km|mi}} south of [[Paderborn]]. On the landing approach one of the engines cut out, stalling the aircraft. All four members of the crew were mortally injured. Three men died shortly after the crash and Lent succumbed to his injuries two days later on 7 October 1944.
