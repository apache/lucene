'''"Weekender"''' is a 1992 single by the band [[Flowered Up]]. The band had performed the song as early as 1991. The song has been described as denouncing people who only go to clubs on the weekend and advocating a party-all-the-time philosophy of the group. The group originally wanted it to be released through their current label [[London Records]]. The single was turned down by the label and released later in April 1992 by [[Heavenly Recordings]].

"Weekender" charted in the United Kingdom for five weeks, peaking at number 20 on the charts. The song received positive reviews on its initial release and was later referred to by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as the group's masterpiece.

==Background and production==
[[London Records]] dropped Flowered Up a few months after the release of their album ''A Life With Brian'' when they refused to release their 12 minute long single for "Weekender".<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/flowered-up-mn0000193146/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|title=Flowered Up|last=Phares|first=Heather|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Sumsion|2003|p=382}} The song was released by [[Heavenly Recordings]] and produced by [[Clive Langer]].<ref name="allmusic-bio" /><ref name="heavenly">{{cite web|url=http://www.heavenlyrecordings.com/heavenly-recordings/|publisher=[[Heavenly Recordings]]|title=Heavenly Recordings est. 1990|accessdate=18 August 2015|last=Barrett|first=Jeff}}</ref> Jeff Barrett, owner of Heavenly Recordings stated that "Weekender" came from the group's "love of drugs and [[Pink Floyd]]."<ref name="heavenly" />

==Style and theme==
Heather Phares of [[AllMusic]] described "Weekender" as denouncing "weekend club-goers" and "advocating a party-all-the-time philosophy that distilled Flowered Up's appeal and ultimate downfall."<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> The song opens and closes with dialogue samples from the film ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'', which [[Simon Reynolds]] described as their "rave-as-mod" analogy.{{sfn|Reynolds|2003|p=382}} The samples include part of Jimmy's resignation speech, where he tells Fulford to shove "that mail and that franking machine and all that other rubbish I have to go about with" up his arse.{{sfn|Glynn|2014|p=113}}

==Release==
The "Weekender" single was released by [[Heavenly Recordings]] in April 1992.<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> A second 12" featured two mostly instrumental remixes by [[Andrew Weatherall]], both even longer than the original song.{{sfn|Reynolds|2013|p=106}} The song charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]] for five weeks, where it peaked at number 20.<ref name="UKchart">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/weekender/| title=Weekender| publisher=[[UK Albums Chart]]|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

===Video===
An 18 minute 20 second video was released for the song directed by [[W.I.Z.]] and starring [[Lee Whitlock]].{{sfn|Luck|2002|p=80}} The video focuses on imagery of scooters, bath tubs, girls and supermarket check outs and has a narrative involving clubbing fuelled by ecstasy.{{sfn|Glynn|2014|p=113}}

==Reception==
[[AllMusic]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that the single was released to critical acclaim.<ref name="allmusic-bio" /><ref name="guardian2009">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/oct/21/liam-maher-flowered-up|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 August 2015|title=How Liam Maher from Flowered Up Changed My Life|date=21 October 2009|last=Turner|first=Robin}}</ref> In a review of a live performance of the group in 1991, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the song as a "shockingly vitriolic new song".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Flowered Up|last=Jennings|first=Dave|work=[[The Guardian]]|page=21|date=14 September 1991|location=London|ISSN=0261-3077}}</ref> ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' described the single as "variously a smart and beady-eyed pop tune, a god-awful heap of retro garbage and a perplexing aural hallucination."<ref name="select">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|title=Reviews: New Singles|last=Harrison|first=Andrew|date=May 1992}}</ref> The review concluded that it couldn't be considered in the running for "Single of the Month" as the track was too long.<ref name="select" />

In Richard Luck's guide book ''The Madchester Scene: The Pocket Essential Guide'', Luck described the song as a "breathtaking, hazy ode to 48 hour party people" and that without the song "we would not be talking about [Flowered Up]".{{sfn|Luck|2002|p=80}} ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' mentioned "Weekender" in their discussion of Essential [[Madchester]] releases, stating that it was "an epic account of ravings highs and lows".<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|title=Essentials|page=98|date=January 2008|last=McClean|first=Craig|volume=24|issue=1|issn=0886-3032}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' later referred to the song as the group's masterpiece.<ref name="guardian2009" />

Writing for ''[[Freaky Trigger]]'' in 1999, critic Tom Ewing ranked the song at number 69 in his list of the "Top 100 Singles of the 90s," saying "'Weekender' is an aggressive, unique record, a record that doesn't want to be made sense of, a surly epic existing to tell you just that no matter what you'll read about 1992 in some future pop textbook, it wasn't like that, wasn't nearly so neat."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ewing|first1=Tom|title=69.
