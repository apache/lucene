'''NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn''' was a [[professional wrestling]] show and [[WWE Network]] [[List of WWE Network events|event]] in the [[NXT TakeOver (series)|NXT TakeOver series]] that took place on August 22, 2015. The NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn event was produced by [[WWE]], showcasing its [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] [[WWE brand extension|brand division]], and streamed live on the WWE Network. The event took place at the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] - the first night of what was billed as a WWE "triple-header" at the arena, with [[SummerSlam (2015)|SummerSlam]] taking place the following evening, and ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' the night after that.<ref name = "Brooklyn TH">[http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/summerslam-location-2016-2017/ Brooklyn Triple Header - Uproxx.com]</ref> This was the first NXT TakeOver held outside of [[Full Sail University]]; WWE promoted it as NXT being "on the biggest stage yet". Starting with [[NXT Arrival]] on February 27, 2014, [[WWE]]'s [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental league]] NXT has held major shows broadcast live on the WWE Network, with the August event being the sixth event in the TakeOver series and was sold out.

There were two main events for the show: a [[ladder match]] for the [[NXT Championship]] with reigning champion [[Finn Bálor]] defending the title against former champion [[Kevin Owens]] and a singles match for the [[NXT Women's Championship]], where Sasha Banks defended her title against Bayley. A match for the [[NXT Tag Team Championship]] was also part of the show with [[The Vaudevillains]] capturing the championship. NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn was the first WWE-promoted event appearance of Japanese wrestler [[Jushin Thunder Liger]], who made a one-off appearance for the company in a match against [[Tyler Breeze]]. The show also marked the TakeOver debut of [[Apollo Crews]], who defeated [[Tye Dillinger]].

===Background===
[[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] is a series of [[professional wrestling]] shows that began on May 29, 2014, as [[WWE]]'s then [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental league]] [[WWE NXT|NXT]] held their second [[WWE Network]] exclusive live broadcast billed as [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|TakeOver]].<ref name=FirstTakeover>{{cite web|last=Howell|first=Nolan|title=Neville tops Kidd at NXT Takeover|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2014/05/29/21705191.html|website=[[canoe.ca]]|date=May 29, 2014|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref> In subsequent months, the "TakeOver" moniker became the brand used by WWE for all of their NXT live specials. Brooklyn was the sixth NXT TakeOver event. 

In July 2015, WWE announced that their latest TakeOver show would take place on August 22, 2015, the day before the 2015 [[SummerSlam (2015)|SummerSlam]] event and would be in the same location as SummerSlam, the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=tagline>{{cite web|title=NXT TakeOver comes to Brooklyn during SummerSlam 2015 Week|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-brooklyn-barclays-center-august-22-27585527|publisher=WWE|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> This would mark the first TakeOver held outside of the [[Full Sail University]] arena in [[Winter Park, Florida]]. WWE promoted the show as "featuring the next generation of WWE... on the biggest stage yet" referring to the 13,000+ capacity of the Barclay Center compared to the 400 seat Full Sail University or the various the arenas NXT had held shows at in the United States that generally could accommodate a couple of thousand spectators at most.<ref name=tagline/><ref name=brooklyndark>{{cite web|last1=Caldwell|first1=James|title=New matches announced for "NXT: Takeover" in Brooklyn|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_87018.shtml|website=PWTorch.com|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>

The card comprised eight matches, including one on the pre-show.

The first match saw [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] face [[Tyler Breeze]]. Liger executed a "[[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|Liger Bomb]]" on Breeze to win the match.

Next, [[Blake and Murphy]] defended the [[NXT Tag Team Championship]] against [[The Vaudevillains|The Vaudevillians]] ([[Aiden English]] and [[Simon Gotch]]). Before the match, [[Leva Bates|Blue Pants]] appeared to support The Vaudevillains. Gotch and English executed the "[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers|Whirling Dervish]]" on Murphy to win the title.

After that, [[Apollo Crews]] faced [[Tye Dillinger]]. Crews executed a [[Professional wrestling throws#Gorilla press drop|gorilla press drop]] followed by a [[Moonsault#Standing moonsault|standing moonsault]] on Dillinger to win the match.

In the fourth match, [[Baron Corbin]] faced [[Samoa Joe]]. The match ended when Joe applied the "[[Rear naked choke|Coquina Clutch]]" on Corbin. Corbin passed out and Joe won by referee stoppage.

In the penultimate match, [[Sasha Banks]] defended the [[NXT Women's Championship]] against [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]]. During the match, Banks applied the "[[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|Bank Statement]]" on Bayley, but Bayley countered the hold to apply the Bank Statement on Banks, with Banks reaching the ropes to force Bayley to break the hold. Bayley executed a "[[Suplex#Belly-to-belly suplex|Bayley-to-Belly Suplex]]" on Banks for a near-fall. In the end, Bayley executed an [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Reverse frankensteiner|inverted frankensteiner]] off the top rope on Banks and a second Bayley-to-Belly Suplex on Banks for a pinfall to win the title. After the match, [[Becky Lynch]] and [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] celebrated with Bayley. Banks hugged Bayley and Bayley, Lynch, Charlotte, and Banks posed for the audience.

=== Main event ===
In the main event, [[Finn Bálor]] defended the [[NXT Championship]] against [[Kevin Owens]] in a [[ladder match]]. During the match, Bálor and Owens fought in the crowd, where Bálor performed a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] over the barricade on Owens. Bálor ran across the broadcast table to perform a [[Dropkick#Front dropkick|running front dropkick]] into a ladder on Owens. Bálor executed a "[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving stomp|Coup de Grâce]]" on Owens and attempted to retrieve the title belt, but Owens pulled Bálor off the ladder, executing a [[powerbomb]] on Bálor. Bálor dove off the ring apron on Owens but Owens avoided and executed a powerbomb onto the ring apron on Bálor. In the climax, Bálor smashed Owens's face into the ladder, who fell onto another ladder, as Balor executed a Coup de Grâce off a ladder on Owens and retrieved the title for the win.

== Reception ==
NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn received widespread critical acclaim. Nick Tylwalk of ''[[Canoe.ca]]'' rated the event 8 out of 10, stating that "while it might not have been the best NXT card to date, it didn't disappoint, as it was headlined by two title matches that matched great in-ring action with solid build-ups." Tylwalk's best-rated match was the NXT Championship ladder match at 9.5 out of 10, and the worst rated match was Corbin-Joe at 4 out of 10. He also highlighted the progress of NXT, writing that it "would have been unthinkable even a few years ago" that "as many people in the same venue that will take in SummerSlam" would pay to "watch the developmental arm of the WWE". Overall, Tylwalk felt that with NXT, it "sure looked" like "WWE has finally manufactured for itself what it's lacked since the heyday of [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]: real competition".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tylwalk|first1=Nick|title=Balor, Owens thrill-packed Barclays Center at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2015/08/23/22543702.html|website=[[Canoe.ca]]|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref>

Benjamin Tucker of the ''[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter]]'' attended in person both NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn and WWE SummerSlam (a day later in the same venue). He gave Brooklyn a 9.0 score, noting that it was "met with near-universal praise", higher than SummerSlam, which rated 6.5 and "was met with ridicule and scorn by the night's end". Apart from approving of its "excellent wrestling", Tucker praised and contrasted the superior writing of Brooklyn with SummerSlam: "NXT provided simple stories, but they were easy to follow and made the viewer root for the good guys to prevail", in addition to "no chicanery". Yet SummerSlam had convoluted stories, "confusingly-presented characters" and "terrible" [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Swerve|swerve]]s. The NXT Women's Championship match, a "grueling 20-minute match that put over both competitors and the title they were fighting for", was said to be a "serious Match of the Year contender" and a cut above all the SummerSlam matches a day later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_87112.shtml|title=Live instant reaction - NXT: Takeover vs. Summerslam highlights the glaring difference between two products|accessdate=22 September 2015|last1=Tucker|first=Benjamin|work=[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter]]}}</ref>

Darren Gutteridge from ''Pro Wrestling Dot Net'' described the event as "fantastic", while declaring that the "brand didn't look out of place on the bigger stage of the Barclays Center, and that is truly remarkable given how young NXT is." He felt that the Women's Championship match was the match of the show and a "perfect crescendo of build, character, and in-ring work", the NXT Championship match was a "very admirable effort" with high "storytelling value" for a ladder match. Gutteridge praised the tag title match as "both teams put forward some of their best work to date". For the remaining singles matches, he felt that the quality of Joe-Corbin was a pleasant surprise, declared that Crews "looked liked he belonged from the second he walked out", but wrote that the Breeze-Liger opener "felt a little ordinary".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.net/article.php?43734|title=WWE NXT Takeover: Brooklyn Hit List|accessdate=22 September 2015|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|last1=Gutteridge|first1=Darren}}</ref>

[[Dave Meltzer]]'s ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' rated the Women’s Championship match as the best of the show at 4.5 out of 5 stars, and the NXT Championship match 4.25 stars. The worst rated match was Crews-Dillinger at 1.5 stars, with the three other matches on the live special episode rated between 2 and 3 stars.<ref>{{cite web|title=NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn|url=http://www.profightdb.com/cards/nxt/takeover-brooklyn-22451.html|publisher=The Internet Wrestling Database|accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref>

NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn won the 2015 Show of the Year Award and Sasha Banks vs Bayley won Match of the Year at the inaugural [[NXT Year-End Award#2015 NXT Year=End Awards|NXT Year-End Awards]] on January 13, 2016.<ref name=NXTawards>{{cite web|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Zack|title= 1/13 Zim’s WWE NXT Live Coverage: Battle Royal to determine Bayley’s next challenger for the NXT Women’s Championship, Dash and Dawson vs. The Ascension, plus Elias Sampson and Tommaso Ciampa in action|url=http://prowrestling.net/site/2016/01/13/113-zims-wwe-nxt-live-coverage-battle-royal-to-determine-bayleys-next-challenger-for-the-nxt-womens-championship-dash-and-dawson-vs-the-ascension-plus-elias-sampson-and-tommaso-ciampa-in-ac/|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}</ref>
