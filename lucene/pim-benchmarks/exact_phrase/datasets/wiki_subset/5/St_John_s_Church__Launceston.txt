'''St Johns Church''', is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Tasmania]] and the oldest church in the city having started construction in 1824.<ref name=abc>{{cite news |last1=Waldhuter |first1=Lauren |title=Secrets of 190-year-old Launceston church; snapshot of city's early life |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-25/secrets-of-190-year-old-launceston-church-revealed/6883324 |accessdate=16 January 2019 |work=ABC News |date=25 October 2015 |language=en-AU}}</ref> Though the church is one of the oldest surviving churches in Australia, it has received numerous extensions and modifications with only the tower and first window pair of the nave being original. St John's Church is located on the corner of [[St John Street, Launceston|St John Street]] and Elizabeth Street and is one of five churches facing onto [[Prince's Square]].

The church's bell was cast by [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] in [[London]].<ref name=abc/>
