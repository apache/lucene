'''Martin-Eloy Lignereux'''  also spelled '''Martin-Eloi'''(1751-1809) was a French [[Marchand-mercier]] or [[decorative arts]] dealer. Active in Paris from 1781, he founded "la Maison [[Lignereux]]". Lignereux was popular among the upper echelons of society both at home and abroad in his own lifetime, furnishing many stately homes and aristocratic residences throughout Europe.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Martin-Eloy Lignereux was born November 1751 in [[Cuvilly]]. At the age of 29 Lignereux opened his own Parisian [[boutique]] as a marchand-mercier, located in [[rue Saint-Honoré]]. This became an influential outlet for [[luxury goods]].

=== La Maison Daguerre & Lignereux ===
In April 1787 Lignereux formed a partnership with Dominique Daguerre. A jewellery dealer, Daguerre was looked upon as a trend-setter by Queen Marie-Antoinette. 

Lignereux and Daguerre become exclusive Parisian retailers for fine china and porcelain creations of the [[Wedgwood]]company.<ref name="JérômeMerceronThesis">{{cite thesis |last=Merceron |first=Jérôme |title=Martin-Eloy Lignereux marchand mercier à Paris à la fin du XVIIIème siècle |oclc=491898660 |date=200 |institution=Université de Paris |type=[[Master_of_Advanced_Studies#France_and_francophone_countries|DEA]]}} Supervised by Alain Mérot and Bill Pallot.</ref><ref>This commercial agreement was arranged through banker Jean-Frédéric Perrégaux in April 1787.</ref> In 1789, Daguerre opened a shop in London, while Lignereux took direction of the Parisian boutique located at 85, rue St-Honoré.  The London store played a key role in the furnishing and decoration of [[Carlton House]] and the [[Royal Pavilion]] of the [[George IV|Prince of Wales]].<ref>Original invoices confirm the importation of richly decorated mantelpieces from Paris, which were then adjusted by artisans in London.</ref>  The [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Manufacture de Sèvres]] chose Maison Daguerre & Lignereux as the sole retailer of Sèvres porcelains in London.

As was common at the time, Lignereux and Daguerre organised several [[auctions]] of their wares. At least two auction sales were set up by maison Lignereux, one at [[Christie’s]] in London in 1791 and the other in Paris in 1793.

=== Caretaker of Marie-Antoinette’s private collection ===
On 10 August 1789, Marie-Antoinette entrusted "Daguerre et Lignereux, marchands bijoutiers", with her personal collection of art, vases, and lacquer boxes. After the Queen’s execution, Lignereux handed this collection over the French state.<ref>"Inventaire des laques anciennes et des objets de curiosité de Marie-Antoinette confiés à Daguerre et Lignereux". 142 pieces are entrusted to Lignereux and Daguerre, including objects made of lacquer, crystal and petrified wood. https://archive.org/stream/archivesdelartfr08guifuoft/archivesdelartfr08guifuoft_djvu.txt</ref><ref name="JérômeMerceronThesis" />

=== La Maison Lignereux ===
When Dominique Daguerre died in 1796, Lignereux was at the head of a robust and internationally known business.<ref>A secret note from the Prefect of Police states in 1807 that "in peacetime, the maison of Daguerre and Lignereux made a turnover of between 1 500 000 and 200 000 000 with foreign countries." [quoted in http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=5474045]</ref> The luxury market in Paris suffered heavily following the French Revolution; commerce with Britain was prohibited (except during the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802-1803), but the Maison Lignereux continued production.

Lignereux moved the Parisian boutique to newly fashionable areas: 2 rue Christine in 1795, then 44 rue Vivienne in 1800, finally to 44 rue Taitbout in 1804, and adapted his work to the current tastes.   Under the [[French Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire|First Empire]], the reputation of the house increased. In 1802 and in 1803, Lignereux was awarded the [[gold medal]] at the [[Exposition des Produits de l'Industrie Française]]. His shop was a major destination for art [[connoisseurs]] and becomes a tourist attraction for wealthy foreigners.<ref name="JérômeMerceronThesis" />

=== Legacy ===
Lignereux had one daughter, Adélaïde-Anne, born in 1782. In 1798, she married cabinetmaker François-Honoré-Georges Jacob, heir to the Jacob dynasty of carpenters and cabinetmakers.<ref>"La dynastie des Jacob": http://www.latourcamoufle.com/artistes-biographie/les-jacob/?language=en</ref> Sculptor [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]] and architect-decorators [[Charles Percier]] and [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] witnessed the wedding.<ref name="JérômeMerceronThesis" />

In 1804, an ill Martin-Eloy Lignereux gave his stock to [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire|Thomire]]. Lignereux died in 1809.<ref name="JérômeMerceronThesis" />  In 2015, a company began trading under the name Lignereux, inspired by the historic company. 

== Works ==

=== Trend-setter ===
Lignereux constantly sought ways of satisfying and surprising an ever-demanding clientele.<ref>Pierre Verlet, Le Commerce des Objets d’Art et les marchands merciers à Paris au XVIIIe siècle, 1958: http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahess_0395-2649_1958_num_13_1_2705</ref><ref name=JérômeMerceronThesis/> From 1787 to 1804, the visual style of his creations continued to evolve. His early Louis XVI objects, influenced by "Anglomania" and the "Chinoiserie", gave way to creations inspired by Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquity popular throughout the [[French Directory|Directory]], [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and [[First French Empire|First Empire]].<ref name=JérômeMerceronThesis/>

=== Collaborations ===
Lignereux was at the heart of a network of [[artists]] and [[artisans]],<ref name=JérômeMerceronThesis/> calling upon them to design and make, under his supervision, collections of decorative art and furniture. He collaborated with cabinetmaker [[Adam Weisweiler]] and sculptors [[François Rémond]] and [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]].<ref>The Stamp of Adam Weisweiller appears on several pieces of furniture which were purchased from the boutiques of Lignereux, in particular in the (former) art collections of the Earls of Elgin and Quentin Craufurd.</ref>

He built a strong relationship with [[Manufacture Nationale de Sèvres|Manufacture de Sèvres]]. In addition to the agreement in London in the 1790s, maison Lignereux acts as a [[retailer]] of Sèvres porcelain in Paris in 1800-1801 and from 1802 to 1804.<ref>http://www.sevresciteceramique.fr/documents/inventaire_des_collections_documentaires_de_la_cita_=doc51.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100727/http://www.sevresciteceramique.fr/documents/inventaire_des_collections_documentaires_de_la_cita_=doc51.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }} p.31, Carton U4.</ref>

=== Clientele ===
Martin-Eloy Lignereux initially benefited from the customer base of Daguerre and, following his partner’s death,   increased this prestigious clientele.

From 1787 to 1804, the most influent connoisseurs acquired objects or furniture from Lignereux. An incomplete list of Daguerre and Lignereux’s clients during the French Revolution is taken from the "Etats des débiteurs, émigrés, non émigrés ou condamnés, de la Société Daguerre et Lignereux". It comprises "M. Perregaux, M. Tolozan, M. d'Aumont Valentinois, les comtes d'Artois, d'Angivillers, de Dillon, de Villequier, le baron de Breteuil, les marquis de Balleroy, de Lusignan, de Polignac, les princes et princesses de Condé, de Lamballe, de Montmorency".<ref>This client list is quoted in the following note: http://www.piasa.auction.fr/_fr/lot/secretaire-de-dame-en-cabinet-il-est-en-placage-de-citronnier-hellip-2274399#.VTEnzmbXcfE http://www.piasa.auction.fr/_fr/lot/secretaire-de-dame-en-cabinet-il-est-en-placage-de-citronnier-hellip-2274399#.</ref>

== Tributes ==
<blockquote>In 1802 and again in 1803, Lignereux was awarded the gold medals at the Exposition des Produits de l'Industrie Française. The Gazette Nationale ou le Moniteur Universel newspaper described the award in 1802 as follows  : "The furniture of 'Citoyen Lignereux' seem remarkable in elegance and richness, through the match of all parties, the choice of appropriate shapes for each piece's destination and finally, through the preciseness and finish of inside and outside work" ; and in 1803 : "Lignereux, rue Vivienne, who earned a [[gold medal]] in Year IX [i.e. 1802]. Awarded subject: furniture. Motive: richness and elegance".<ref name=JérômeMerceronThesis/></blockquote>Several visitors have admired the splendour of the art objects and furniture offered at Lignereux’s:
