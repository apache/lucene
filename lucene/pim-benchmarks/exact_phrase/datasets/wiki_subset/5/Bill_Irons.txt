Together with [[Napoleon Chagnon]] he organized a set of symposia for the 1976 annual meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] exploring the use of [[behavioral ecology]] in anthropology. In 1979 this led to the publication of a volume edited by Chagnon and Irons entitled ''Evolutionary Biology and Human Social Behavior: An Anthropological Perspective'' encompassing much of the earliest work in anthropology designed to evaluate evolutionary theories of human behavior. Irons, Chagnon and Lee Cronk also co-edited the volume ''Adaptation and Human Behavior: An Anthropological Perspective''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Adaptation_and_Human_Behavior.html?id=yZB4n Adaptation and Human Behavior: An Anthropological Perspective]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Google Books</ref>
