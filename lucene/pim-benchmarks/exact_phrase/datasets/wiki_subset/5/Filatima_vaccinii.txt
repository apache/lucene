'''''Filatima vaccinii''''' is a [[moth]] of the family [[Gelechiidae]]. It is found in [[North America]], where it has been recorded from [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]] and [[New Jersey]].<ref>[http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/insecta/lepidoptera/ditrysia/gelechioidea/gelechiidae/gelechiinae/filatima/ Filatima at funet]</ref><ref>[http://mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu/species.php?hodges=2179 mothphotographersgroup]</ref>

The [[wingspan]] is 16â€“18&nbsp;mm. The forewings are grey, each scale tipped with fuscous and with four small fuscous spots on the fold and in the cell. There is an ill-defined narrow, outwardly convex transverse fascia at the apical fourth, from the costa to the tornus. The hindwings are fuscous with a brassy hue, darker apically 
than basally.

The larvae feed on ''[[Vaccinium vacillans]]''.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/journalofwashi3637194wash#page/270/mode/1up J. Wash. Acad. Sci. 37 : 270]</ref>
