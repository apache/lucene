It was broadcast live on the WWE Network, available to subscribers. TakeOver: Unstoppable took place on May 20, 2015 at NXT's "home" arena, [[Full Sail University]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]] and featured six matches as part of the televised broadcast and one that was a [[dark match]] that occurred prior to the televised portion of the show. It was the fifth show in the [[NXT TakeOver (series)|TakeOver series]] of Network exclusive shows. 

The main event of the show was a rematch from [[NXT TakeOver: Rival|TakeOver: Rival]] as [[Kevin Owens]] defended the [[NXT Championship]] against [[Sami Zayn]], the man he had won it from at the previous TakeOver. During the show [[Samoa Joe]] made his surprise NXT debut during the main event match.

==Production==
===Background===
[[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] is a series of [[professional wrestling]] shows that began on May 29, 2014, as [[WWE]]'s then [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental league]] [[WWE NXT|NXT]] held their second [[WWE Network]] exclusive live broadcast billed as [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|TakeOver]].<ref name=FirstTakeover>{{cite web|last=Howell|first=Nolan|title=Neville tops Kidd at NXT Takeover|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2014/05/29/21705191.html|website=[[canoe.ca]]|date=May 29, 2014|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref> In subsequent months, the "TakeOver" moniker became the brand used by WWE for all of their NXT live specials. Unstoppable was the fifth NXT TakeOver event.

The card comprised six matches, as well as one [[dark match]] before the broadcast. The matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]], [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], or [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Tweener|less distinguishable characters]] that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines were produced on their weekly television program, ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]''.<ref name="HSW">{{cite web|title=How Pro Wrestling Works|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|work=HowStuffWorks|publisher=[[Discovery Communications]]|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LDla2zy5?url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm|archivedate=November 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name=WWEnt>{{cite web|title=Live & Televised Entertainment|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/events.jsp|publisher=WWE|accessdate=March 21, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5esskNFVE?url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/events.jsp|archivedate=February 26, 2009}}</ref>

Owens performed a [[Powerbomb#Pop-up powerbomb|pop-up powerbomb]] onto the ring apron on Zayn. As Zayn appeared to have injured his shoulder and was unable to compete, the match came to a halt but Owens continued to attack his injured opponent, drawing out NXT General Manager [[William Regal]]. Regal raked Owens's face but Owens retaliated with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Headbutt|headbutt]]. [[Samoa Joe]] appeared, making his surprise debut, to stop Owens's attack.
