== History ==
Grouard, named after Bishop [[Émile Grouard]], was originally incorporated as a village on September 27, 1909<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.municipalaffairs.alberta.ca/cfml/pdf_search/pdf/TOWN/0335/Wainwright_Establishment_of_Village_1909_No17.pdf|title=Annual Report of the Department of Public Works of the Province of Alberta, 1909|publisher=Government of Alberta|page=144|year=1910|accessdate=October 26, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215153732/http://www.municipalaffairs.alberta.ca/cfml/pdf_search/pdf/TOWN/0335/Wainwright_Establishment_of_Village_1909_No17.pdf|archivedate=February 15, 2016}}</ref> and then as a town in December, 1912.
