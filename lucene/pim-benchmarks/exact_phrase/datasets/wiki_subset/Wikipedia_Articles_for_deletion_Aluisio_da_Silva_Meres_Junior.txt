*'''Strong keep''' - The article is in a terrible state, but it's clear that he's played in the Brasileiro Serie A and the Turkish Super Lig (both fully-pro leagues). I've added some references and tried to clean the article a bit, but it needs plenty of care. [[User:Jogurney|Jogurney]] ([[User talk:Jogurney|talk]]) 14:29, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

*'''Withdraw''' The creator create a terrible stub. I forget check his career in Turkey is my fault.
