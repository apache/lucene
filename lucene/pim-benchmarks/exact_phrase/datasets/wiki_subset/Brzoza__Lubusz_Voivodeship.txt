'''Brzoza''' {{IPAc-pl|'|b|ż|o|z|a}} (formerly German ''Birkholz'') is a [[village]] in the administrative district of [[Gmina Strzelce Krajeńskie]], within [[Strzelce-Drezdenko County]], [[Lubusz Voivodeship]], in western Poland.<ref name="TERYT">{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.pl/broker/access/prefile/listPreFiles.jspa |title=Central Statistical Office (GUS) - TERYT (National Register of Territorial Land Apportionment Journal) |date=2008-06-01 |language=Polish}}</ref> It lies approximately {{convert|4|km|mi|0}} west of [[Strzelce Krajeńskie]] and {{convert|22|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]].

The village was first mentioned as a possession of a knight in 1337.  It was purchased in 1605 by Ernst von Schöning, the member of a well known Neumark family.  The village was passed down, first to field marshal [[Hans Adam von Schoning]], and then his son [[Johann Ludwig von Schöning|Johann Ludwig]] in 1696.  In 1713, [[George Wilhelm von Schöning]] constructed a hunting castle and granary on the site.

Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see ''[[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II]]'').
