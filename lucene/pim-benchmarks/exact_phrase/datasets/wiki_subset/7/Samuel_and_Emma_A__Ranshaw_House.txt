The '''Samuel and Emma A. Ranshaw House''' is a historic building in [[North Liberty, Iowa]], United States.  At the time this house was built in 1908, North Liberty was a small and prosperous farming community.<ref name=Rogers>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=12000814}}|title=Samuel and Emma A. Ranshaw House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2017-05-23|author1=Leah D. Rogers|author2=Melissa A. Alien}} with {{NRHP url|id=12000814|photos=y|title=photo(s)}}</ref>  The Ranshaws engaged [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]] architect-builder Bernard Wickham to design and construct this transitional Free Classic subtype of the [[Queen Anne architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] style.  It is characterized by simple classical decorative details that were becoming popular in the early 20th-century, as opposed to the more elaborate elements of the [[Victorian architecture|Late Victorian]] style. It was a typical house that Wickham was building in this area.<ref name=Rogers/>  The {{convert|10|acres|adj=on}} farmstead on which it was built was surrounded by farm fields just to the west of the town.  Suburban development now surrounds the house on its {{convert|2|acres|adj=on}} lot.  In addition to the house, a concrete sidewalk and [[cistern]] cap with inlaid glass marbles that are set in geometric and floral patterns is included in the nomination.  They were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2012.<ref name="nris"/>
