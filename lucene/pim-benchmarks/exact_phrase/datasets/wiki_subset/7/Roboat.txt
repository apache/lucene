'''Roboat''' is a [[research program]] on autonomous floating systems in [[Amsterdam]]. The program, scheduled to last five years from 2016, is developing the world's first fleet of [[Unmanned surface vehicle|autonomous vessels]], focussing on moving people and goods, portable infrastructure and data gathering.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-transportation-netherlands-robots-idUSKCN11P200|title=Roboats ahoy: Amsterdam canals picked to test self-driving fleet|date=2017-09-19|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602414/fleets-of-robotic-boats-are-getting-ready-to-set-sail/|title=Fleets of robotic boats are getting ready to set sail|last=Condliffe|first=Jamie|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ams-institute.org/roboat-qa/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925013832/https://www.ams-institute.org/roboat-qa/|title=Roboat Q&A||author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=2016-09-18|work=AMS Institute|access-date=2017-05-23|archive-date=2016-09-25|url-status=dead|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://senseable.mit.edu/roboat/|title=Roboat / MIT Senseable City Lab|website=senseable.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/design/self-driving-boats-mit/index.html|title=Self-driving boats unleashed in Amsterdam|first=Kieron |last=Monks|website=CNN|access-date=2017-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/self-driving-boats-will-soon-be-setting-sail|title=Self-driving boats will soon be setting sail|last=Lott-Lavigna|first=Ruby|work=WIRED UK|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/amsterdam-to-get-driverless-roboats-on-its-canals-10585841|title=Amsterdam to get driverless 'roboats' on canals|work=Sky News|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/09/19/get-ready-self-driving-boats-coming-too/90685394/|title=Get ready, self-driving boats are coming, too|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}</ref> Roboat is a project of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute).
