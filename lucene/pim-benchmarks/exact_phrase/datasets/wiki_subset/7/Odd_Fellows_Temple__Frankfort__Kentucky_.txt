The '''Odd Fellows Temple''' of [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] is a three-story structure built in 1871 at 315 Saint Clair Street. Historically the top floor served as the [[fraternal lodge]] of the [[Odd Fellows]], with the remainder of the building leased for commercial purposes.

The Odd Fellows of Kentucky was established in 1834. On March 24, 1840, the Capital Lodge of Frankfort was chartered as the 6th lodge in [[Kentucky]].  After meeting in several locations downtown, the Capital Lodge built a permanent home along Broadway in 1848. Following a devastating fire on November 1, 1870 that destroyed the lodge and most of a downtown commercial block between Saint Clair and Ann Streets, the lodge was rebuilt. This new lodge building was constructed on Saint Clair Street with the support of over 350 members and a special bond approved by the Kentucky Legislature.

The former lodge stands as one of the largest and earliest extant IOOF lodges in the Kentucky. Completed on Jan 1, 1872, the building was dedicated on January 30, 1872 and served the local chapter for 110 years until funding necessitated its sale in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=Odd Fellows Lodge 177th birthday brings hope to historic order|url=http://www.state-journal.com/2017/03/23/odd-fellows-lodge-177th-birthday-brings-hope-to-historic-order/|publisher=The State Journal|accessdate=7 June 2017|date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as a [[contributing building]] in the [[Frankfort Commercial Historic District (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Frankfort Commercial Historic District]].
