The '''1924 United States presidential election in Rhode Island''' took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the [[1924 United States presidential election]] which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. 

[[Rhode Island]] voted for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, incumbent President [[Calvin Coolidge]] of [[Massachusetts]], over the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, Ambassador [[John W. Davis]] of [[West Virginia]]. Coolidge ran with former [[Office of Management and Budget|Budget Director]] [[Charles G. Dawes]] of [[Illinois]], while Davis ran with [[List of governors of Nebraska|Governor]] [[Charles W. Bryan]] of [[Nebraska]]. Also in the running that year was the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)|Progressive Party]] nominee, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert M. La Follette]] of [[Wisconsin]] and his running mate Senator [[Burton K. Wheeler]] of [[Montana]]. La Follette’s support base was primarily among rural [[German Americans|German]] and [[Scandinavian Americans]],<ref>[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]] and Christiano, Kevin J.; ‘Support for the American Left, 1920-1924: The Opiate Thesis Reconsidered’; ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'', Vol. 31, No. 1 (March, 1992), pp. 62-75</ref> and he possessed little appeal in the Northeast outside a few New York and Boston [[Prohibition in the United States|anti-Prohibition]] precincts. This was especially true in Rhode Island where La Follette’s opposition to the [[League of Nations]] was severely unpopular,<ref name=Geography55>Menendez, Albert J.; ''The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004'', p. 55 {{ISBN|0786422173}}</ref> and consequently Rhode Island was La Follette’s sixth-weakest state and weakest outside the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] where the lower classes were almost entirely disfranchised.

Coolidge won Rhode Island by a margin of 23.17%. His victory was also enjoyed a unique personal popularity which helped him in the state and the rest of [[New England]]. He was the epitome of a traditional New England [[Yankee]], having been born in the small-town of [[Plymouth Notch, Vermont]], and establishing his political career nearby as [[Governor of Massachusetts]]. Thus Coolidge remained especially popular with voters across the New England region.

The 1920s were a fiercely Republican decade in American politics, and Rhode Island in that era was a fiercely Republican state in presidential elections. The economic boom and social good feelings of the [[Roaring Twenties]] under popular Republican leadership virtually guaranteed Calvin Coolidge an easy win in the state against the conservative Southern Democrat Davis. Although Davis’ reticence on the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was opposed by large Catholic populations in Rhode Island, his status as the solitary pro-League of Nations candidate helped him in the Ocean State with its large immigrant population. Consequently Davis gained almost 4% on Cox’s 1920 vote and in fact Rhode Island was his third strongest state in the North and West (behind New Mexico and Indiana), giving Davis a vote percentage 7.64% above his national figure.

In effect, Davis’ gain would begin Rhode Island's transition from a strongly Yankee Republican state into a Democratic-leaning state, made definitive via Catholic [[Al Smith]]’s win 4 years later. Rhode Island would not vote for another Republican presidential candidate until [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[1952 United States presidential election in Rhode Island|1952]], and since 1924, Republicans have only carried the state four times.
