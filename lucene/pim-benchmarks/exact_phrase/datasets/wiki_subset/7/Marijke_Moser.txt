== Life ==
From the age of five to twelve, Marijke van de Graaf lived with her parents in [[Indonesia]], where her father was physician.<ref>Robert Peterhand, [http://zueriraennt.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Moser-Marijke_5.2017.pdf Laufpionierin mit Idealen]</ref> In 1970 she married Albrecht Moser who was a member of the same athletics club in [[Hilversum]] in the Netherlands, after which the couple moved to [[Bern]]. Moser campaigned for the right of women to run in all races. She managed to participate in the male-only Morat-Freiburg race in 1971 as a "clandestine" entry. She registered as a man named Markus Aebischer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tdg.ch/sports/actu/La-longue-course-des-femmes-de-l-injustice-a-levidence/story/14667211|title=La longue course des femmes, de l’injustice à l’évidence|work=tdg.ch/|access-date=2017-05-23}}</ref> Moser ran in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Women's 1500 metres|1500m at the 1972 Olympics]] for Switzerland.<ref name="SportsRef">{{cite Sports-Reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/marijke-moser-1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200418123902/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/marijke-moser-1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 April 2020 |title=Marijke Moser Olympic Results |accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> She came 8th in the first heat and she was eliminated before the final.<ref name=sr>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200317184438/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/down.html Marijke Moser], SR Sports, Retrieved 23 May 2017</ref> In October 1974 Moser finished a marathon at [[Neuf-Brisach]] with a time of 2:59:24. Having dual nationality, this made her the first Dutch and first Swiss woman to run the marathon under 3 hours. She never improved on this time, though in 1978 she became the first official Swiss female marathon winner in a time of 2:59:38.<ref>Wim Zonneveld, [http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/2017/04/marijke-moser-de-eerste-nederlandse-marathonvrouw-onder-de-drie-uur/ Marijke Moser: de eerste Nederlandse marathonvrouw onder de drie uur], at sportgeschiedenis.nl (in Dutch)</ref>
