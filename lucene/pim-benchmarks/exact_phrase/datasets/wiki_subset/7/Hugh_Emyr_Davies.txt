'''Hugh Emyr Davies''' (31 May 1878 &ndash; 21 November 1950) was a Welsh Presbyterian minister, and poet. His parents were Tudwal and Annie Davies of [[Abererch]], [[Caernarfonshire]]. He received his early education at [[Pwllheli]] County School and [[Clynnog]] School. He later studied at UCW ([[Aberystwyth]]), and at [[Bala College]]. In 1909 he was ordained, and was appointed minister of [[Llanddona]], [[Anglesey]]. In 1912 he moved to Lodge, Brymbo and Ffrith, before moving back to [[Anglesey]], to [[Llanfechell]], in 1920. After retirement he moved to live in [[Holyhead]] and in the [[Menai Bridge]] area. He died in 1950 in [[Llandegfan]].

He was known as an excellent preacher, but was also regarded an exceptional poet. He won a bardic chair at [[Pwllheli]] Eisteddfod at the age of 16, and subsequently won 22 bardic chairs.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

His writings include the poem "Branwen ferch Llŷr" (which won him the crown at the [[Caernarfon]] National Eisteddfod in 1906, while he was still a student at Bala),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambrian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWglAAAAMAAJ|year=1906|publisher=T.J.

In 1907 a collection of his works was published under the title 'Llwyn Hudol'.
