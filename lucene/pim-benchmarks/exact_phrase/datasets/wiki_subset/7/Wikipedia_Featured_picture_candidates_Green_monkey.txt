* '''Oppose''' – Sorry, please find a picture where the entire body of the monkey is visible.

:* Why not have a look at [[Wikipedia:Featured pictures]] and you will see that FPs do not have to of entire bodies of animals or people. [[User:Charlesjsharp|Charlesjsharp]] ([[User talk:Charlesjsharp|talk]]) 19:26, 25 May 2017 (UTC)
::*Most of them  have full body pictures. I expect species should be identified properly in FP.
