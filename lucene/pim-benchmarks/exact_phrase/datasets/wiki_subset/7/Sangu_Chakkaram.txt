===Critical reception===
''Times of India'' wrote "Given that the horror-comedy wave is now at its ebb, Sanguchakkaram feels late by at least two-three years. It doesn't help that Maarison deals mostly with cliches to tell us his story."<ref>{{Citation|title=Sanguchakkaram Movie Review, Trailer, & Show timings at Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie-reviews/sanguchakkaram/movie-review/62291632.cms|accessdate=2018-03-23}}</ref> ''New Indian Express'' wrote "Sangu Chakkaram offers nothing radical in terms of story, but there are certain redemptive moments".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/review/2017/dec/30/sangu-chakkaram-review-doesnt-ever-light-up-1739981.html|title='Sangu Chakkaram' review: Doesnâ€™t ever light up|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>
