'''Klemetsrud Church''' is a white-painted wooden [[Church (building)|church]] in the south eastern edge of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. The church was consecrated on September 3, 1933. Architects of the church were [[Herman Major Backer]] (father of [[Lars Backer]]), and [[Einar Engelstad]]. Engelstad took over when Backer died the year before the church was finished.<ref name="nokb" />

The church was restored and expanded in 1982 with a separate congregation hall and chapel (designed by Rolf Christian Krognes). In the winter of 2008/09 an interior renovation was carried out.

The [[pulpit]] and the [[altar]], as well as the chairs in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] are carved by [[Anthon Røvik]]. The [[altarpiece]] is painted by [[Olaf Willums]]. The church has two [[church bells]] made by the [[Olsen Nauen Bell Foundry]], cast the same year as the church was opened. The largest bell has a monogram of King [[Haakon VII]] on one side and the following inscription on the other side: "Klemetsrud kirke. Jeg kaller kom. Joh. 3.16" ("Klemetsrud Church. I call to come. [[Gospel of John|John]] 3.16. ") The [[church organ]] is made by [[Josef Hilmar Jørgensen]] (delivered in 1933).<ref name="nokb" /><ref>Knut Are Tvedt (ed.): Oslo Byleksikon (5th ed.; [[Kunnskapsforlaget]], 2010), page 306 {{in lang|no}}</ref>
