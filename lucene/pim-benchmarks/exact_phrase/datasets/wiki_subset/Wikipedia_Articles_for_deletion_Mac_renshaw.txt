I know Mac personally. He's lucky to have his own bibliography on here! Come on, just leave it on! - Frankwaters

*'''Strong Delete''' or '''speedy''' per nom. 15-year-old with some very non-specific and non-verifiable claims of athletic awards and such.  '''[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22Mac+renshaw%22&btnG=Search 6 Google hits]''', all look unrelated as far as I can tell.  Pathetic attempts at sockpuppeting make my vote a Strong Delete.

The Swimming Competitions were held incompetecne of the School. they will not appear on any websites from google or anything thats for sure. Mac Renshaw was awarded 3 years ago a Science award. (scroll down to mac renshaw) http://scienceawards.bhpbilliton.com/repository/studentWinners/studentWinnersEncouragement2003.asp  
He does have a place on this website he is athletically and educationally blessed. - Charlie33
*'''Delete''' Certanly not notable, regardless of how many friends he's got. Vanity page. [[User:EivindFOyangen|Eivind]] 14:20, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Good point there Charlie. it clearly shows that Mac was won an award. And as far as medal tally's for swimming goes, they wont be very easy to come across. Only the Australian Swimming Association will have that data as well as schoold competing. - Bob Barne

I agree with everybody else. I think that it should be left there. I have read paper articles explaining what a true champ he is to his school, family and all his friends. He has put it a great deal of effort and he truly deserves this page ! - Ashlee Heir

I have heard a great deal about this kid and how he swims. Never met him or saw him but he definately deserves this page from what i have heard and read! Frank Frutz

*'''Delete''' nn--[[User:Porturology|Porturology]] 23:54, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. The claim is that he is a famous Australian swimmer. A  Google search disproves this claim given that he only gets 6 hits, none of which verifies this. [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=lang_en&safe=off&q=%22Mac+Renshaw%22&btnG=Search] A search of an Australian and New Zealand database gets no results as well. Given that prominent Australian swimming meets are shown on primetime television, a notable swimmer would have a much higher profile than that.

*'''Speedy delete'''. Non-notable bio. And delete all those photos too, where someone's just Photoshopped Mac's head onto other photos. [[User:Cnwb|Cnwb]] 00:48, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I'll [[WP:AGF]], and assume that when [[User:Hilbilly]] blanked the page and forged his vote signature (as [[User:Cnwb]]), all in his ''very first edit'', he actually meant to vote legitimately as himself. So, here's what he had to say: "''Dont Delete His notable, i have done research using the AUS swimming Carnival access page.''"

* To paraphrase what Maccy said at the top of the page, '''Delete'''. He is not at all notable down here in AUS!  --[[User:Roisterer|Roisterer]] 11:20, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Strong Delete''' - The article contains lots of OBVIOUSLY FALSE claims
** There is no Australian Championships in March - they were in February as the Comm Games are during March
** He is not on any Australian swim squad for any international meet - go through archives at www.swimming.org.au
** Getting an encouragement award in BHP Billiton awards is nn

*'''Delete''' I was about to close this early and delete it, because "Clear deletion concensus, possible speedy (there are claims of notability, which may or may not be hoaxes)." Then I discovered that [[WP:DP#Early_closings|early closing]] is not allowed if the result is to be a formal deletion. So, since there's vague assertions of notability, and I can't close early, we have to leave this lying around for a few more days. Isn't process great? --[[User:Kingboyk|kingboyk]] 02:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
