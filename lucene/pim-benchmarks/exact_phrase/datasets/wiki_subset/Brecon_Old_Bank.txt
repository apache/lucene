The '''Brecon Old Bank''' was founded in [[Brecon]] in 1778 by Mr John Wilkins (1713-1784),<ref name="Llgc">https://biography.wales/article/s-WILK-INS-1350 Retrieved 30 September 2009</ref> who was highly regarded by the directors of the [[Bank of England]].<ref name="Green">Early Banks in West Wales, by Francis Green (in West Wales Historical Records, The Annual Magazine of [[The Historical Society of West Wales]], Volume VI, edited by Francis Green, Printed by W.

==Development==

The bank was originally operated under the style Wilkins & Co. and developed steadily, opening up branches in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], in 1812, and [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Carmarthen]] and [[Haverfordwest]], in 1832.<ref name="Green" /> The branch at Brecon is now the site of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]].<ref name="Pevsner1">Haslam, R., 2001, [[Pevsner Architectural Guides]], The Buildings of Wales, [[Powys]], Penguin Books/University of Wales Press {{ISBN|0-14-071051-5}}</ref>  The branch at Cardigan was located on the High Street next to Lloyds Bank, in a building ‘sizeable, but not grandiose, red brick above a stone mullioned bank front, with pretty stained glass’.<ref name="Pevsner">Lloyd., T., Orbach., J., Scourfield, R., 2006, [[Pevsner Architectural Guides]], The Buildings of Wales, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, Yale University Press {{ISBN|0-300-10179-1}}</ref>

After 1830, the enterprise operated under the name Brecon Old Bank.<ref name="Green" /> The bank did well in [[West Wales]], but did encounter a run against its assets in 1866, the year of the [[Overend, Gurney and Company]] failure in [[London]]. Around a hundred [[depositor]]s claimed that they wanted their money back to erect water mills, while others said they wanted to build new houses and other buildings. However, bank officials had sufficient resources to meet all calls for this fictional building boom, and all [[cheque]]s were paid promptly.<ref name="Green" /> Depositors were then invited to re-deposit money with the bank once their fears were over. The run on the bank lasted seven days. Afterwards, nearly every depositor reopened  an account at the bank.<ref name="Green" />

==Sale to Lloyds Bank==

In 1890, Brecon Old Bank was sold to Lloyds Bank Ltd., after a successful period of trading.<ref name="Green" /> Around 1876, the partners in the bank were John Evans, William de Winton, Henry Jones Evans, T. J. Evans, E. B. Evans and W. S. de Winton.

W. S. De Winton became an active director in Lloyds Bank Ltd.<ref name="Green" />
