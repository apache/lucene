'''Colm Ó Lochlainn''' (1892 – 26 June 1972) was a printer, typographer, collector of Irish ballads and traditional Irish [[Uilleann pipes|Uilleann piper]]. He was notably the author of ''Irish Street Ballads'' published in 1939 and ''More Irish Street Ballads'' in 1965.<ref>{{Citation | last=Meek | first= Bill| title=Tribute to Colm Ó Lochlainn |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] | page= 10 | date=31 July 1972}}</ref>

==Life==
A native of [[Kilkenny]], Ó Lochlainn was a member of the [[Irish volunteers]] in 1916. He was part of a team which was sent to Kerry on Good Friday in a bid to seize radio equipment for communication with The Aud, a German ship transporting arms from Germany for the Easter Rising. He and a colleague, Denis Daly made it to their destination but a second car transporting three others crashed into the river at Ballykissane, Killorglin, killing three members of the team, Con Keating, Donal Sheehan and Charlie Monaghan.

Ó Lochlainn established the Candle Press in 1916. It was the winner of a bronze medal for bookbinding in 1924.

He founded his own press, At the Sign of the Three Candles Press, in 1926. He gave the aspiring piper [[Seamus Ennis]] his first job at this press,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100128024430/http://www.ramblinghouse.org/2009/07/seamus-ennis/ Piper and collector Seamus Ennis]</ref> and Ennis collaborated with him on the ''Irish Street Ballads'' books. He succeeded Seamus Ó Casaide as volunteer editor of ''Irish Book Lover'' in 1930.

He was an assistant in the Faculty of Modern Irish at [[University College Dublin]] from 1933 to 1943, where he later became professor of Irish Language and Literature. He was also associated with the founding of [[An Óige]].<ref name =obit>{{Citation | last=Obituary | title=Colm Ó Lochlainn |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] | page= 6 | date=29 June 1972}}</ref>

About 1940 he began the publication in Dublin of an undated series of penny Irish-language songsheets entitled An Claisceadal ("choral singing").  This was originally the name of an informal choral group of Irish-language enthusiasts which had been brought together in Dublin in 1928.

==Family==
[[Seamus Ennis]] was godfather to Colm's son Ruan, a renowned musician who played with [[Bees Make Honey]] and recorded with artists such as [[Bryan Ferry]], [[Link Wray]] and who was a founding member of [[Ronnie Lane]]'s Slim Chance. His other son Dara played jazz with the [[Chicago Jazz Seven]].<ref name =jazz>{{Citation | last=Report | title=Music|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] | page= 12 | date=11 November 1972}}</ref> His daughter Aifric is an art therapist and artist. His grandson Fionn Ó Lochlainn is also a critically acclaimed recording artist and musician, who played in [[Dónal Lunny]]'s 'Coolfin'.
