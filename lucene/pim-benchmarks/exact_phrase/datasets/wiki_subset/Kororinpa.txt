{{nihongo|'''''Kororinpa'''''|コロリンパ||known as '''''Kororinpa: Marble Mania'''''  in North America}} is a [[video game]] for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] [[video game console]]. It was released in Japan on December 2, 2006 as a launch title for the Wii, then in Europe on February 23, 2007 and North America on March 20, 2007.

==Gameplay==

Kororinpa is based on the Marble game Labyrinth but with a new twist. Instead of using little knobs on the sides to tilt the level, the player rotates the [[Wii Remote|Wiimote]] as if they were holding the twisted pathways as opposed to a plastic piece with a sensor. There are 40 levels that increase in difficulty sequentially and eventually require some speed as well as accuracy.

In ''Kororinpa'', the player tilts the playing field, using the [[Wii Remote]] to navigate a spherical object around mazes to reach the end goal, similar to ''[[Marble Madness]]'', ''[[Marble Blast Gold|Marble Blast]]'' and the [[Super Monkey Ball (series)|''Super Monkey Ball'' series]]. Some mazes cause the player to tilt them in such a way so that a wall becomes a floor, or to interact with objects such as magnets or conveyor belts. Each level contains a number of orange crystals and a single green crystal. Collection of all orange crystals is necessary for progression, while green crystals are optional, but unlock secret levels. In addition, players may be awarded with bronze, silver, or gold trophies for completing levels within a predetermined amount of time. Obtaining these trophies unlocks new balls, music, and 5 additional bonus levels. Once the forty-five single-player levels have been completed, a mirror mode is unlocked.

The game has received mixed, but predominately positive, criticism. [[IGN]] UK awarded the game a score of 6.1 out of 10, citing the game as being "hard not to warm to", noting the "jolly soundtrack and cunning level design difficult to resist". However, they criticized the game for its lack of levels or challenge, and its "ill-conceived camera". British gaming magazines ''[[NGamer]]'' and ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' were less critical, awarding ''Kororinpa'' scores of 81 out of 100 and 80% respectively. ''ONM'' praised the game for its control method and multiplayer mode. On [[GameRankings]], the game has received an average of 70% from 21 reviews.

''Kororinpa'' sold only 2,416 copies on December 2, 2006, the day of the [[Wii launch]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=December 4, 2006 | title=Wii Sports Number One in Japan | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/749/749151p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2010-04-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016213256/http://wii.ign.com/articles/749/749151p1.html | archive-date=October 16, 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref>
