*'''Comment''': doesn't satisfy [[WP:MILPEOPLE]], and currently is completely unreferenced. However, the professional golf aspect might be enough to establish notability if details of his golf career could be fleshed out with some sources. Having said this, I couldn't really find anything that I feel is significant coverage in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], in this search: [http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=bill+leyden+golfer&aq=0&aqi=g2&aql=&oq=Bill+Leyden+golf&gs_rfai=]. Thus, if nothing suitable can be found, I feel that the best course of action is to delete. [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 08:59, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Despite the accounts of his battle experiences in the book ''Brotherhood of Heroes'' and other works focusing on the experiences of the "common soldier", he doesn't seem to meet [[WP:MILPEOPLE|our notability requirements]] as a military figure. He doesn't show up at all in a search for past and present pro golfers at the PGA Tour website, so notability derived from golfing seems unverifiable as well. He [http://books.google.com/books?id=2fb7T9vxeVAC&pg=PA357 seems to be] a guy whose eyewitness testimony has been found useful by writers recounting the war in the Pacific, but I don't think that's enough to support a biographical article.
