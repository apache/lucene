*'''Strong Keep''' I am not sure why on earth this article should be tagged - Devlin is Head of the Canadian Army! [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 20:23, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

:He was the Canadian Battle Group Commander in Bosnia - the article already makes that clear. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 20:44, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

::Google gives circa 16,000 hits for General Peter Devlin - which is not surprising seeing he is head of the Canadian Army! Of course google hits is not proof of notability but it is an accepted indicator. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 20:57, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' Not notable, Devlin progressed normally up to the rank of LGen with no particular exceptional involvement which would demonstrate notability in such a capacity. As a comparable [[Romeo Dallaire]] also attaining the rank of LGen is notable based on his personal involvement in the Rwandan Genocide, publishing a widely selling book about same and becoming a serving Canadian Senator.--[[User:Jemesouviens32|Jemesouviens32]] ([[User talk:Jemesouviens32|talk]]) 20:37, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

:He was indeed the Canadian Battle Group Commander in Bosnia, so were several other Canadian Generals it is notability that I am questioning not his appointments. As a reference [[Lewis MacKenzie]] served in the Balkans as well and is considered by Wikipedians to be imminently notable.--[[User:Jemesouviens32|Jemesouviens32]] ([[User talk:Jemesouviens32|talk]]) 20:53, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

*'''Strong Keep''' Seems notable to me. --[[User:Diego Grez|Diego Grez]] <sup>[[User talk:Diego Grez|let's talk]]</sup> 21:26, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. The subject is inherently notable by virtue of the position he holds- comparable to the [[Chief of the General Staff  (United Kingdom)]] or the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]]. How distinguished a career he had up to now, I don't know, but he's notable by virtue of being the professional head of a national army- one comprised of some 36,000 troops according to our article. I'd urge the nominator to withdraw this AfD.

*I'm slightly questioning the judgment of the person who nominated this article. It's (fairly) well written and is about a notable subject. '''Keep it'''.

*'''Keep'''. While they aren't binding, I believe the [[WP:MILPEOPLE|notability guidelines at WikiProject Military History]] are useful.  They include those who have "[h]eld a rank considered to be a flag or general officer, or their historical equivalents; or....held the top-level military command position of their nation's armed forces (such as Chief of the General Staff), or of a department thereof (such as Chief of Army Staff)".  Both of these apply here and I think it is standard practice on Wikipedia for LGen-equivalents to have articles. -[[User:Joshuapaquin|Joshuapaquin]] ([[User talk:Joshuapaquin|talk]]) 03:20, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' The position makes him notable. Gets in the news sometimes as well for doing things related to his duties, the news people thinking he notable enough to mention.[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22General+Peter+Devlin%22+source%3A%22-newswire%22+source%3A%22-wire%22+source%3A%22-presswire%22+source%3A%22-PR%22+source%3A%22-press%22+source%3A%22-release%22+source%3A%22-wikipedia%22&btnG=Search+Archives&scoring=a] [[User:Dream Focus | '''<span style="color:blue">D</span><span style="color:green">r</span><span style="color:red">e</span><span style="color:orange">a</span><span style="color:purple">m</span> <span style="color:blue">Focus</span>]]''' 04:29, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

The Canadian military is very small comparatively to most other armed forces of countries with over 34 million citizens, Devlin commands not even a division light, in effect, a Major-Generals' responsibility in other armies. Lastly, nothing against the good General as I would recommed reclassification as non notable all [[Chief of the Land Staff]] with the exception of [[Maurice Baril]] because of his personal involvement in decision making  relating to the [[Rwandan Genocide]] as a significant part of the UN chain of commmand at the time.--[[User:Jemesouviens32|Jemesouviens32]] ([[User talk:Jemesouviens32|talk]]) 06:35, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
*Further to the above, the [[Canadian Forces]] number 67000 active duty personel and 106 General/Flag Officers http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dsa-dns/sa-ns/ab/gfo-oga/index-eng.asp?mLimit=Genwhich meaning that a Canadian General/Flag Officer commands a total of 632 servicewomen and men, in most armed forces that number of people ([[Battalion]] size) are commanded by a Major or Lieutenant-Colonel all of which serves to illustrate my point above.--[[User:Jemesouviens32|Jemesouviens32]] ([[User talk:Jemesouviens32|talk]]) 07:14, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''' There is nothing about the rank of Lieutenant General which compares to normal rank progression. It is notable in itself bolstered by his position in the Canadian Army as well. Secondary publications adequately substantiated his notability in numerous examples.[[User:My76Strat|My76Strat]] ([[User talk:My76Strat|talk]]) 23:07, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
