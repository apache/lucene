'''Richard Bornat''' (born 1944), is a British author and researcher in the field of [[computer science]]. He is also professor of [[Computer programming]] at [[Middlesex University]]. Previously he was at [[Queen Mary, University of London]].

== Research ==

Bornat's research interests includes ''program proving'' in [[separation logic]]. His focus is on the [[Proof theory|proof]]s themselves; as opposed to any logical underpinnings. Much of the work involves discovering ways to state the properties of independent modules, in a manner that makes their composition into useful systems conducive.

Bornat (in conjunction with [[Bernard Sufrin]] of the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory]]) developed [[Jape (software)|Jape]], a [[proof calculator]]; he is involved in research on the usability of this tool for exploration of novel proofs.

Richard Bornat's PhD students have included [[Samson Abramsky]] in the early 1980s.

In 2004, one of Bornat's students developed an aptitude test to ''"divide people up into programmers and non-programmers before they ever come into contact with programming."'' The test was first given to a group of students in 2005 during an experiment on the use of mental models in programming.<ref>{{cite paper|url=http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf|title=The camel has two humps|publisher=School of Computing, Middlesex University, UK|author=Dehnadi,Saeed & Bornat, Richard|date=20 February 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122080500/http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2008 and 2014, Bornat partially retracted some of the claims,<ref>{{cite paper|url=http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/r_bornat/papers/camel_hump_retraction.pdf |title=Camels and humps: a retraction|publisher=School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London, UK|author=Bornat, Richard|date=24 July 2014}}</ref> impugning its validity as a test for programming capability.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/18/the-camel-doesnt-have-two-humps-programming-aptitude-test-canned-for-overzealous-conclusion/|title=The camel doesn't have two humps: Programming "aptitude test" canned for overzealous conclusion - Retraction Watch|date=2014-07-18|work=Retraction Watch|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Publications ==

Bornat published a book entitled ''"Understanding and Writing Compilers: A Do It Yourself Guide"'', which is regarded as one of the most extensive resources on [[compiler]] development. Although it has been out of print for some time, he has now made it available as an [http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/r_bornat/books/compiling.pdf online edition].
