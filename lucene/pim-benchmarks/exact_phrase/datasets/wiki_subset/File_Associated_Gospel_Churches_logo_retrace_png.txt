# This image is a low-resolution image of the [[logo]] of a Christian denomination.
# This image does not limit the copyright holder's ability to profit from the original source, nor will it dilute the importance or recognition of the logo in connection with its organization.
# This image enhances the article in which it's displayed, as it provides an immediate relevance to the reader more capably than the textual description alone.
#Use of the logo visually identifies the denomination's doctrines and operations in a manner that mere prose cannot, and meets all criteria in [[WP:NFCC]].
|Replaceability=Not replaceable; logos are always presumed non-free per [[WP:LOGO]].
