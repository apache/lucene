'''Vakhtang I''' ({{lang-ka|ვახტანგ I მუხრანბატონი}}, ''Vakhtang I Mukhranbatoni'') (1511 – 1 October 1580) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] ''[[tavadi]]'' ("prince") of the [[House of Mukhrani]], a collateral branch of the royal [[Bagrationi dynasty]] of [[Kingdom of Kartli (1484–1762)|Kartli]], and Prince (''[[batoni (title)|batoni]]'') of [[Mukhrani]] from 1539 until his death. At the same time, he was an ''[[ex officio]]'' commander of the [[Sadrosho|Banner]] of [[Shida Kartli]]. In the absence of his relative, King [[Simon I of Kartli]], in the captivity in [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Iran]], Vakhtang was installed by the nobility as a regent in opposition to the pro-Safavid regime of [[David XI of Kartli|Daud-Khan]] from 1569 to 1579.

== Family background ==
Vakhtang was a son of [[Bagrat I, Prince of Mukhrani|Prince Bagrat]], the founder of the House of Mukhrani and a younger son of [[Constantine II of Georgia|Constantine II]], the last ''de jure'' king of a [[Kingdom of Georgia|unified Georgia]]. He was, therefore, first cousin to King [[Luarsab I of Kartli]] and first cousin once removed to Luarsab's son and successor, Simon I. Among his siblings were a sister, [[Dedisimedi]], and brothers, [[Ashotan I, Prince of Mukhrani|Ashotan]] and [[Archil, Prince of Mukhrani|Archil]].<ref name="Vakh">{{cite book|last=Bagrationi|first=Vakhushti|script-title=ru:История Царства Грузинского|trans-title=History of the Kingdom of Georgia|year=1976|publisher=Metsniereba|location=Tbilisi|pages=39–43|url=http://www.nplg.gov.ge/dlibrary/collect/0001/000029/Istoria_Carstva_Gruzinskogo.pdf|authorlink=Prince Vakhushti of Kartli|editor=Nakashidze, N.T.|language=Russian|access-date=2013-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195829/http://www.nplg.gov.ge/dlibrary/collect/0001/000029/Istoria_Carstva_Gruzinskogo.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-29|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Allen">{{cite book|title=Russian Embassies to the Georgian Kings, 1589-1605|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|editor=[[William Edward David Allen|Allen, W.E.D.]]|page=545}}</ref>

== Prince of Mukhrani ==
Vakhtang succeeded as Prince of Mukhrani on retirement of his father to a monastery in 1539. During his tenure, [[Mukhrani]], a buffer zone on the border with the rivaling Georgian [[kingdom of Kakheti]], experienced several military conflicts. In 1554, the Safavid invasion forced Vakhtang and his family into a temporary exile to [[Samtskhe]]. One of brothers, Archil, was captured by the Iranian military in 1557 and another, Ashotan, was killed when the mountaineers of [[Pkhovi]] raided Mukhrani in 1561.<ref name="brosset">{{cite book|last=Brosset|first=Marie-Félicité|title=Chronique géorgienne, traduite par m.

== Regent of Kartli == 
In 1569, the Safavid forces made Simon I of Kartli prisoner and the [[shah]] [[Tahmasp I]] placed Simon's Islamized brother David (Daud-Khan) on the throne of Kartli. David's authority was limited to the areas tightly controlled by the Iranian military as most of the Christian nobles of Kartli refused to recognize a Muslim overlord and made Vakhtang a regent of Kartli. In 1578, Kartli once again became a battleground of the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)|Ottoman–Safavid war]]. After Daud-Khan burned down his capital, [[Tbilisi]], before [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign|abandoning it]] to the Ottoman army under [[Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha]], Vakhtang, as a regent of Kartli, sent Bardzim, [[Amilakhvari|Prince Amilakhvari]], and Elizbar, [[Duchy of Ksani|Duke of Ksani]], to come to common terms with the victor, saving, as the 18th-century historian [[Prince Vakhushti]] put it, "the people from annihilation".<ref name="brosset"/><ref name="Vakh"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Rayfield|author-link=Donald Rayfield|first=Donald|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|year=2012|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1780230303|page = 176}}</ref> 

In October 1578, Simon I, released by the shah from captivity, returned to Kartli and struck at the Ottoman garrisons as well as his old foes. One of them, Bardzim Amilakhvari, was arrested and, as Vakhtang tried to intercede, he too was imprisoned by Simon at the castle of Kekhvi. Simon's wife, [[Nestan-Darejan of Kakheti, Queen of Kartli|Nestan-Darejan]], moderated the king's anger and Vakhtang was soon released. He died shortly thereafter, in 1580, being succeeded as Prince of Mukhrani by his son, [[Teimuraz I, Prince of Mukhrani|Teimuraz I]], under the regency of Vakhtang's nephew [[Erekle I, Prince of Mukhrani|Erekle I]].<ref name="brosset"/><ref name="Vakh"/>

== Marriage and children ==
Vakhtang was married to a certain Khvaramze and had three sons: [[Teimuraz I, Prince of Mukhrani]] (died 1 July 1625), [[Kaikhosro, Prince of Mukhrani|Kaikhosro]] (died 3 October 1629), and Bagrat (born 16 July 1572).<ref name="bag">{{cite book|title=ბაგრატიონები. სამეცნიერო და კულტურული მემკვიდრეობა|trans-title=Scientific and Cultural Heritage of the Bagrationis|year=2003|publisher=Neostudia|location=Tbilisi|isbn=99928-0-623-0|editor=Metreveli, Roin|editor-link=Roin Metreveli|language=Georgian, English|page=Table 8}}</ref> The historian [[Cyril Toumanoff]] considers Teimuraz and Bagrat to have been the same person.<ref>{{cite book|last=Toumanoff|first=Cyrille|author-link=Cyril Toumanoff|title=Les dynasties de la Caucasie Chrétienne: de l'Antiquité jusqu'au XIXe siècle: tables généalogiques et chronologique|language=French|trans-title=Dynasties of Christian Caucasia from Antiquity to the 19th century: genealogical and chronological tables|year=1990|location=Rome|page=556}}</ref>
