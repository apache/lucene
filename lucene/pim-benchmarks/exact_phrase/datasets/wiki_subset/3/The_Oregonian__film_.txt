Michael Nordine from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' rated the film one and a half out of four stars, calling the film "a jumbled mess that can’t make its deliberate incoherence interesting".<ref name="nordine12">{{cite web |last1=Nordine |first1=Michael |title=Review: The Oregonian - Slant Magazine |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-oregonian/ |website=SlantMagazine.com |publisher=Slant Magazine |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref> Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' offered the film similar criticism, writing, "Reeder shows a knack for unsettling audiovisual textures, but once it’s clear ''The Oregonian'' will offer no real storyline or explanations, viewer patience wears thin".<ref name="harvey2011">{{cite web |last1=Harvey |first1=Dennis |title=The Oregonian – Variety |url=https://variety.com/2011/film/reviews/the-oregonian-1117944488/ |website=Variety.com |publisher=Variety Magazine |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref>

The film was not without its supporters'
David D'Arcy from [[Screen Daily]] commended the film's atmosphere, soundtrack, and Pulsipher's performance.<ref name="d'arcy11">{{cite web |last1=D'Arcy |first1=David |title=The Oregonian |url=https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/latest-reviews/the-oregonian/5022823.article |website=ScreenDaily.com |publisher=Screen Daily |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref> David Fear of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' rated the film three out of five stars, writing, "though Reeder’s attempts to unnerve sometimes veer close to enfant terrible posturing, ''The Oregonian'' knows how to work its unpleasantness to primo psychotronic effect".<ref name="timeoutreview">{{cite web |last1=Fear |first1=David |title=The Oregonian |url=https://www.timeout.com/us/film/the-oregonian |website=TimeOut.com |publisher=Time Out Magazine |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref> Eric Kohn from [[IndieWire]] awarded the film a score B+, writing, "Alternately creepy, puzzling and assaulting on the senses, at best ''The Oregonian'' functions as a nightmarish headtrip with ample doses of dark comedy". Kohn, however, criticized the film's third act, which he felt 'failed to put its compelling fragments together'.<ref name="kohn2011">{{cite web |last1=Kohn |first1=Eric |title=A Wacky Roadtrip in Calvin Lee Reeder’s "The Oregonian" |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2011/01/sundance-review-a-wacky-roadtrip-in-calvin-lee-reeders-the-oregonian-54551/ |website=IndieWire.com |publisher=IndieWire |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref>
