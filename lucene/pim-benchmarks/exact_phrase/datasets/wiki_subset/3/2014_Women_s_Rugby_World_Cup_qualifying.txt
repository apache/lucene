==Qualification process==
Following WRWC 2010, six teams received an automatic qualification berth - these berths being given the top 3 teams (New Zealand, England, and Australia), the hosts (France), Canada, and the United States. The remaining six berths for the tournament will be awarded through regional tournaments.

The non-automatic qualification process began on 5 February 2012. Twenty teams competed in over 49 matches to win one of the six remaining places at the 2014 tournament.

==Regional qualification==
There will be 12 nations participating in the [[2014 Women's Rugby World Cup]]. Six teams have automatically qualified by virtue of their performance at the prior Rugby World Cup, leaving six teams to qualify through regional matches. Regional Qualification began on 5 February 2012, during the first round of the [[2012 Women's Six Nations Championship]].

In all, 26 national teams have been involved in the 2014 World Cup - six as automatic qualifiers and 20 as entrants in the qualification rounds.
