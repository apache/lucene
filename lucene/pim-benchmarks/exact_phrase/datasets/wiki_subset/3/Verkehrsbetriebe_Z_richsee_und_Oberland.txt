== History ==
In the first half of the 20th century, the region between Lake Zürich and the Zürcher Oberland was served by a number of rail lines. These included a [[standard gauge]] [[steam railway]], the [[Uerikon-Bauma-Bahn]], and two [[metre gauge]] [[electric tram]]ways, the [[Wetzikon-Meilen-Bahn]] and the [[Uster-Oetwil-Bahn]]. These three lines were operating with large financial losses, and it was decided to replace them with buses. The VZO was founded to operate these replacement service, and over the years more routes in the area were added.<ref name=vzohist>{{cite web | url = http://www.vzo.ch/geschichte_de.cfm | title = Geschichte | language = German |trans-title=History | publisher = VZO | accessdate = 2013-10-03}}</ref>

In 2008, the VZO started operating in Rapperswil-Jona, where it now operates five routes of the ''Stadtbus Rapperswil-Jona'' on behalf of the municipality of Rapperswil-Jona.<ref name=vzomarket/><ref name=vzosbrj>{{cite web | url = http://www.vzo.ch/stadtbus_rapperswil-jona_de.cfm | title = Stadtbus Rapperswil-Jona | language = German |trans-title=Rapperswil-Jona City Bus | publisher = VZO | accessdate = 2013-10-03}}</ref>
