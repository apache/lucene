The '''Broadlands Dam''' (also known as the '''Broadlands Hydropower Project''' by the developers) is a {{nowrap|35 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} [[run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] hydroelectric complex  currently under construction in [[Kitulgala]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The project is expected to be completed in 2020, and will consist of two dams, and a power station further downstream.<ref name=CeylonToday>{{cite news|title=Broadlands Hydropower project work begins on Monday|url=http://www.ceylontoday.lk/16-37595-news-detail-broadlands-hydropower-project-work-begins-on-monday.html|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=Ceylon Today|date=2013-07-14}}</ref><ref name="Daily News">{{cite news|title=Broadlands hydro power project construction work inaugurated|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/local/broadlands-hydro-power-project-construction-work-inaugurated|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]|date=2013-07-16}}</ref>

With an estimated annual generation capacity of {{nowrap|126 [[GWh]]}}, the facility will be the country's last major hydroelectric project, due to the exhaustion of island-wide hydropower potential. Construction of the project was ceremonially inaugurated by the {{nowrap|[[Ministry of Power and Energy|Minister of Power and Energy]]}} {{nowrap|Mrs. Pavithra Wanniarachchi}} at the auspicious time of 11:01 on {{nowrap|17 July 2013}}.<ref name=SundayObserver>{{cite news|title=Broadlands hydro power project to be constructed|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2013/07/14/new40.asp|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Observer]]|date=2013-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212707/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2013/07/14/new40.asp|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=CEB>{{cite web|title=Major Projects: Broadlands Hydro Power Project|url=http://www.ceb.lk/sub/dp/majorprojects.aspx?xghGKfllumv=6|publisher=[[Ceylon Electricity Board]]|accessdate=2 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112061445/http://www.ceb.lk/sub/dp/majorprojects.aspx?xghGKfllumv=6|archivedate=12 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Dams and reservoirs ==
The primary [[gravity dam]] measuring {{Convert|24|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height and {{Convert|114|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length is being constructed across the [[Maskeliya Oya]] at Kitulgala, and will supply water to the power station via a {{Convert|3404.7|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} [[penstock]] measuring {{Convert|5.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=BHPCEB>{{cite web|title=About the Broadlands Hydropower Project|url=http://www.bhpceb.lk/index_files/Page379.htm|publisher=BHPCEB.lk|accessdate=2 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212909/http://www.bhpceb.lk/index_files/Page379.htm|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A secondary [[gravity dam|gravity]] [[weir]], measuring {{Convert|19|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|48|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height and length, is also to be built in the vicinity, over the nearby [[Kehelgamu Oya]], to provide additional hydroelectric capacity. The weir, to be called the Kehelgamu Weir, will create a catchment area of {{Convert|176|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, and will provide additional [[hydraulic head|head]] to the penstock of the main dam via a {{Convert|811|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tunnel.<ref name=BHPCEB />

The penstock from the main dam will feed a power station consisting of two {{Nowrap|3-phase synchronous}} [[Francis turbine|turbine]]s, each of {{nowrap|17.5 MW}} and a rated discharge of {{Nowrap|{{Convert|32|m3|ft3|0|abbr=on}} per second}}.<ref name=BHPCEB />
