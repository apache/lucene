The article was entered with a purpose to record it as an event and includes a reference from the only accountable source, explanation of the distribution utility. Anyway, should be deleted if not applies to Wiki rules. And sorry if I wrote this somewhere wrong, I don't know all the exact discussion rules and ways for the topic.

*'''Delete''' [[WP:NOTNEWS]].[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 17:39, 2 October 2013 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. I don't see anything wrong with this topic and I don't see how [[WP:NOTNEWS]] applies. None of the points listed on that page seem to apply to the article, so how can it be used as a deletion reason. How is an event that affected millions of people for two hours not notable? [[User:CodeCat|CodeCat]] ([[User talk:CodeCat|talk]]) 15:17, 4 October 2013 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' [[WP:EVENT]]. This is just passing local news that is not notable as an encyclopaedia entry. All that happened was that a device failed in a substation. Power failures occur all the time; they are trivialities outside their own locality. There have been power failures in my neighbourhood that did not even make the news.

*'''Keep''' A blackout which affects at least 1.5 million people is notable. Maybe it needs more references. But it has nothing to do with deleting. [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 18:02, 5 October 2013 (UTC)
::Nightfall affects many more people every day than a power cut, but we have an article about the rotation of the earth; we do not devote articles to describing each nightfall. An encyclopaedia is not an anthology of brief electrical incidents with local effects. There was nothing unique about this power loss: it was brief and it did not alter the course of history. It is a triviality. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, not a newspaper. [[:File:Usher statue - closeup.jpg|<font color="#2424BD" size="3" face="Courier New">'''—&nbsp;O'Dea'''</font>]] ([[User talk:O'Dea|talk]]) 08:49, 6 October 2013 (UTC)
:In a way, I quite agree with O'Dea.This is an encyclopaedia and not a newspaper. But you can see many articles about blackout events in WP. ([[2003 Italy blackout]], [[2003 London blackout]],  [[ Northeast blackout of 1965]] etc.)  (In fact many others about other evil events such as eartquakes,  floods and fires ) Deleting only this one without deleting the others is not fair. [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 16:44, 6 October 2013 (UTC)
::The argument that there are other blackout articles is an example of [[Wikipedia:Other stuff exists]] (please read), meaning it is an invalid argument. Indeed, [[2003 London blackout]] should also be deleted. 

::[[Northeast blackout of 1965]] is notable because it was an international blackout affecting 30 million people. It was sensational and unprecedented at the time; it astonished people so much that it featured afterwards in works of popular culture. [[2003 Italy blackout]] is another international incident that affected 56 million people. An entire nation, Italy, lost power for 13 hours, the most serious blackout there for 70 years.

::Please do not create distractions with "earthquakes, floods and fires". We are talking about a temporary loss of electricity, not natural disasters. The blackout in Trakya was a small regional loss of power that affected only 1.5 million people for only two hours. Such blackouts occur frequently throughout the world and are therefore a normal feature of life, and do not warrant encyclopaedia articles about them. They rarely ever make news outside the affected region or nation. In Costa Rica alone, nationwide blackouts are a constant feature of life. Here are news reports of just a few of them: in [http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/1997/agosto/13/pais7.html 1997], [http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2001/marzo/08/pais1.html 2001], [http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/abril/20/pais1068727.html 2007], and [http://www.nacion.com/archivo/Vergonzoso-apagon-Estadio-Nacional_0_1274672701.html 2012]. None of these warrant encyclopaedic study.

::The question of "fairness" does not arise in a discussion such as this. It is a red herring. Wikipedia does not exist to promote or undermine justice. Trakia will not experience painful jealousy just because the major Italian blackout has a Wikipedia article.

* '''Delete'''. Non-notable: transient event affecting relatively small region. Has not generated sufficient comment in reliable sources.--[[User:Traveling Man|Larry]] ([[User talk:Traveling Man|talk]]) 19:09, 10 October 2013 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' to the [[List of major power outages]] which includes "notable" power interruptions, with the  relevant criterion being that it affected more than 1,000,000 person-hours, in this case 1.5 million people for over 2 hours or 3 million "person hours." If someone refers to other articles about similar events which survived AFDs, then it should not be dismissed out of hand as an "other stuff exists" argument since it might be a way to point to the consensus as to what level of disruption makes something notable enough for an article or for inclusion in a list such as the one I found.  For a major outage which survived AFD, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2011 Southern California power outage]]. The list of major outages itself survived multiple AFDs.  For an example of one which was smaller  like this one and got merged to the list, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Southern Portugal Blackout of 2000]]. Comparison of a blackout to it getting dark at night is not sensible, since twilight does not strand people in elevators or shut off traffic signals, water and sewage handling and medical equipment. It does not make sense to argue for deletion on the basis of some simple equipment failure or human error in setting a protective relay being the root cause. We look at effects, and their coverage, rather than causes in determining notability. [[User:Edison|Edison]] ([[User talk:Edison|talk]]) 19:50, 10 October 2013 (UTC)
::The suggestion to merge to [[List of major power outages]] is redundant; the power failure has been <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_major_power_outages&diff=574456879&oldid=573888057 documented there since September 25th]</span>, so deletion remains the preferred choice.
