==Plot==
An international architecture student at [[University of Western Australia]] and martial arts champ, Julian finds work as a [[House sitting|house sitter]] for the wealthy owners of a luxury home in [[Perth]]. His new job causes friction with his girlfriend Clare, who he was supposed to live with. The house and wealth it exudes open up a realm of opportunities for Julian, and he is seduced by the mysterious and attractive Anna. Subsequently, his relationship with Clare falls apart, and he struggles to regain momentum in a martial arts championship. His academic life is threatened when his final university assignment disappears. When he speaks to the owner of the house, he mentions meeting the niece but is told that's impossible as she is away, and the name "Anna" gets a furious reaction. He asks a neighbour to shed some light on the conversation and it is revealed that a junkie died after getting into the house and falling down the stairs. He recognises Anna in the news photo. When she returns he acknowledges that she is a ghost; she turns monstrous and tries to persuade him to kill himself. His friends and girlfriend come to check on him but are too late to save him from falling down the stairs to his death, just like Anna.

==Reception==
The film received a generally positive reaction from Australian cinema magazine, ''[[Filmink]]''. "''Crush'' delivers most of what it sets out to do. A busy soundtrack enhances the experience (itself a rarity), while muscular production and the eye candy appeal of Egan and Lung (the film's biggest asset) push proceedings a notch or two above similar movies. [...] it's all handled with enough flair to make the popcorn experience worthwhile."<ref>[http://www.crushthemovie.com/FILMINKREVIEW.jpg Film reviews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128155312/http://crushthemovie.com/FILMINKREVIEW.jpg |date=28 January 2011 }} Filmink.
