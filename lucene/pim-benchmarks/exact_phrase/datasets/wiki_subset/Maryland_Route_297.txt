MD 297 was constructed in the late 1920s and reconstructed in the early 1970s. The highway from Butlertown to [[Newtown, Maryland|Newtown]] was part of MD 297 between 1942 and 1993.

==Route description==
[[File:2017-08-11 19 16 50 View south along Maryland State Route 297 (Worton Road) at Maryland State Route 298 (Lambs Meadow Road) in Butlertown, Kent County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|View south along MD 297 at MD 298 in Butlertown]]
MD 297 begins at MD 213 (Augustine Herman Highway) north of Chestertown. The two-lane undivided highway heads north and parallels the Chestertown Branch of the Northern Line of the [[Maryland and Delaware Railroad]] north of Mary Morris Road. MD 297 crosses the rail line at-grade in the community of [[Worton, Maryland|Worton]], where the route passes west of Worton Regional Park. The highway continues to its northern terminus at MD 298 (Lambs Meadow Road) just west of Kent County High School in the hamlet of Butlertown. The highway continues on the opposite side of MD 298 as county-maintained Smithville Road.<ref name="Maryland HLR"/><ref name="Maryland grid map"/>

==History==
MD 297 was constructed as a concrete road from the [[U.S. Route 213]] (now MD 213) end starting in 1926.<ref name="1926 src report"/> The highway was completed to Mary Morris Road in 1927.<ref name="1927 map"/> MD 297 was extended through Worton to Butlertown in 1928.<ref name="1928 map"/> Smithville Road was improved and transferred to the state highway system from Butlertown through Smithtown to the village of Newtown in 1942.<ref name="memo 1942-02-26"/> The portion of MD 297 from US 213 to MD 298 was reconstructed in 1973.
