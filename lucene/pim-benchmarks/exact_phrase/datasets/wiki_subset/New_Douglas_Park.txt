'''New Douglas Park''', currently known as the '''Fountain of Youth Stadium''' for sponsorship purposes, is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire]], Scotland, which serves as the home of [[Scottish Premiership]] side [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]]. It takes its name from [[Douglas Park]], the club's former stadium which was located immediately to the south of the current site.

==Stadium==
The stadium is located in the north of Hamilton, close to the [[Burnbank]] and [[Whitehill, Hamilton, Scotland|Whitehill]] residential areas and to [[Hamilton West railway station]]. Construction of the stadium was completed by [[Ballast Nedam]] in 2001; the initial intention was for its name to be ''The Ballast Stadium''.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19046004.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725033414/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19046004.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=25 July 2018 | work=[[The Sunday Herald]] | title=Nice new stadium, shame about the name | first=Tom | last=Shields |via=[[HighBeam Research]]| date=29 July 2001|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76792686.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725063320/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76792686.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=25 July 2018 | work=Daily Record | title=Football: Accies have a Ballast at new home |via=[[HighBeam Research]]| date=27 July 2001|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>

The pitch was converted to artificial [[FieldTurf]] in 2004, the more durable surface allowing the club to hold training sessions and [[youth system|youth academy]] matches there without damaging the playing field for first team matches. After Hamilton was promoted to the [[Scottish Premier League]] in May 2008, the artificial surface had to be replaced by [[lawn|grass]] due to league rules, an alteration which owner Ronnie MacDonald claimed had cost £850,000 (including the installation of [[Under-soil heating|undersoil heating]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/hamilton-chairman-ronnie-macdonald-on-why-he-rates-1009464|title=Hamilton chairman Ronnie MacDonald on why he rates Billy Reid as the top manager in the SPL|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=12 February 2009|accessdate=28 July 2018}}</ref> In addition to the turf replacement, a small temporary stand with a capacity of 500 was erected in March 2008 to bring the stadium's capacity up to the league requirement of 6,000 all seater.

At the beginning of season 2013–14, Hamilton returned to an artificial playing surface, this time produced by ''TigerTurf''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tigerturf.com/uk/hamilton-academical-new-douglas-park-stadium |title=Hamilton Academical New Douglas Park Stadium |publisher=TigerTurf|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref> with an installation cost of £400,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/13261954.Hamilton_Accies_set_to_roar_on___400_000_Tigerturf_pitch/|title=Hamilton Accies set to roar on £400,000 Tigerturf pitch|work=[[Evening Times]]|date=17 August 2013|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref> In June 2018, that surface was voted as the worst of 42 [[Scottish Professional Football League|SPFL]] venues in a survey of the league's players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stv.tv/sport/football/1417163-hamilton-accies-pitch-voted-as-worst-in-scotland/|title=Hamilton Accies' pitch named worst in SPFL by players|publisher=[[Scottish Television|STV]]|date=4 June 2018|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref> The following day, the club made public their intention to install a new ''Greenfields'' surface in time for the 2018-19 season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.bt.com/football/hamilton-splash-out-for-high-grade-new-pitch-S11364276263498|title=Hamilton splash out for high-grade new pitch |work=[[BT Sport]]|date=5 June 2018|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref> costing £750,000 and with the same specification as the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] performance centre at [[Oriam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hamilton-accies-splash-750k-new-12650279.amp|title=Hamilton Accies splash £750k on new artificial surface to improve New Douglas Park|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=5 June 2018|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greenfields.eu/uk/projects/Football?p=2|title=Football: Projects|publisher=Greenfields UK|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref>

In July 2016 it was announced that as part of a £750,000 sponsorship deal, New Douglas Park would be renamed the ''SuperSeal Stadium'' after a deal was agreed with [[Glasgow|Glasgow-based]] home improvements company SuperSeal.<ref name="SuperSeal sponsor">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hamilton-accies-announce-biggest-sponsorship-8419071#9mmOKpAQtWe70Vqe.97 |title=Hamilton Accies announce biggest sponsorship package in their history |first=Andy |last=McGilvray |work=Daily Record |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=14 July 2016 |accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref> In July 2018 it became the ''Hope CBD Stadium'' following another sponsorship deal with a firm providing [[Cannabidiol#Society and culture|cannabidol products]] owned by the club's chief executive Colin McGowan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/media-leisure/hamilton-accies-stadium-to-be-named-after-cannabis-oil-firm-1-4775067|title=Hamilton Accies' stadium to be named after cannabis oil firm |work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=27 July 2018|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44987242|title=Hamilton Academical: Club defend cannabis plant sponsorship decision|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=27 July 2018|accessdate=28 July 2018}}</ref> In July 2019 it changed again to the ''Fountain of Youth Stadium'' in another sponsorship deal worth £750,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/hamilton-accies-football-club-sign-16516333|title=Hamilton Accies Football Club sign £750k stadium deal|work=Daily record|date=15 June 2019|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>
