The result was '''Speedy delete'''. Non-admin closure; article was speedy deleted but discussion was still open after deletion was made. Hopefully I'm allowed to do this.

*"All of the essays are of a deeply personal nature, giving insight to a controversial mind that playfully embraces all that is rotten and maladjusted.".  Not as rotten as this promotional piece though.  '''Delete'''.  [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] 05:04, 19 May 2007 (UTC).
