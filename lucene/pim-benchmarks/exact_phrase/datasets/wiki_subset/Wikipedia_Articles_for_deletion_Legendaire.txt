===[[Legendaire]]===
I came across this when I was in Loughborough town, I live in South Wales and was therefore interested to understand what it meant. Naturally I inputted it into Wikipedia. Is this not what Wiki is for? How else would I be able to discretely understand what the term meant? Dylan Davies

:*Hardly a valid reason. Just because you and people you know use the term doesn't mean it's worthy of inclusion in an encyclopaedia. Furthermore, Wikipedia is [[WP:DICDEF|not a dictionary]].
