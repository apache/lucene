The '''New York State Treasurer''' was a state cabinet officer in the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] between 1776 and 1926. During the re-organization of the state government under Governor [[Al Smith]], the office was abolished and its responsibilities transferred to the new Department of Audit and Control headed to the [[New York State Comptroller]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080924185353/http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/research/res_topics_env_guide_3_dac.shtml] Department of Audit and Control, at NY Archives</ref>

==History==
In 1776, the [[New York Provincial Congress]] appointed [[Peter Van Brugh Livingston]] Treasurer to disburse the monies raised and issued in the revolutionary operations of the day.<ref name="Hough1858">{{cite book |last1=Hough |first1=Franklin Benjamin |title=The New York Civil List: Containing the names and origin of the civil divisions, and the names and dates of election or appointment of the principal state and county officers from the Revolution to the present time |date=1858 |publisher=Weed, Parsons and Co. |location=Albany |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newyorkcivillis00houggoog/page/n61 35]-36 |url=https://archive.org/details/newyorkcivillis00houggoog |accessdate=30 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

After the establishment of the state government, the Treasurer was appointed by special act of the [[New York State Legislature]] for short periods.

Under the [[New York State Constitution]] of 1821, the Treasurer was elected by joint ballot of the State Legislature.

Under the Constitution of 1846, the office became elective by general election, and the Treasurer was elected with the other state cabinet officers in odd years to a two-year term, serving in the second year of the governor in office and the first year of the succeeding governor. The Treasurer was elected in 1895 to a three-year term, and subsequently was elected in even years and served a two-year term concurrently with the governor until the end of 1926.
