==History==
===Early history===
The [[non-commercial educational|non-commercial]] UHF channel 47 allocation was contested between two groups that vied to hold the [[Planning permission#Broadcasting|construction permit]] to build a new station on the frequency. The first prospective permittee was the [[David Livingstone]] Missionary Foundation, a nonprofit religious corporation headed by [[Billy James Hargis]], a Tulsa-born evangelist, who founded American Christian College; the foundation filed an application with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) on April 17, 1978. The second applicant, Alden Communications Corporation, filed its own application on September 5. The FCC granted the license to the Livingstone Missionary Foundation on December 12, 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/78-OCR/1978-05-15-BC-OCR-Page-0057.pdf|periodical=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=[[PDF]]|page=57|date=May 15, 1978|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/78-OCR/1978-09-18-BC-OCR-Page-0088.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=88|date=September 18, 1978|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref> After vying for the [[Planning permission#Broadcasting|construction permit]] for a year-and-a-half, Alden and the Livingstone Foundation proposed consolidating their respective permit applications; soon, Livingstone Church of Christian Crusade, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/80-OCR/1980-03-03-BC-OCR-Page-0069.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=67|date=March 3, 1980|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref> Following a March 1980 hearing in which the FCC determined issues regarding the respective licensing proposals, the Hargis group (which by that time, had transferred the permit application to another of his organizations, Church of Christian Crusade, Inc.

That request was protested by the [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps-Howard Broadcasting]], which contested that the assignment would create confusion with Scripps-owned NBC affiliate [[KJRH-TV]] (channel 2); however, the FCC Broadcast Bureau stated that calls were sufficiently different to prevent confusion in part because KJRH was a VHF station, and granted CCC use of the callsign in January 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/81-OCR/1981-06-22-BC-OCR-Page-0077.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=79|date=July 2, 1979|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/82-OCR/1982-01-11-BC-OCR-Page-0096.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=96|date=January 11, 1982|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/82-OCR/1982-01-25-BC-OCR-Page-0108.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=108|date=January 25, 1982|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref>

In October 1983, Church of the Christian Crusade sold an 85% interest in the permit to [[Oral Roberts University]] (ORU) for 85% of FCC-approved expenditures totaling $255,000; the FCC granted approval of the transaction on January 12, 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=Changing Hands|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/83-OCR/BC-1983-10-31-OCR-Page-0071.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=71|date=October 31, 1983|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/83-OCR/BC-1983-10-31-OCR-Page-0078.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=78|date=October 31, 1983|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-01-30-OCR-Page-0104.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=79|date=January 30, 1984|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref> However, ORU would later back out of the transaction that spring, at which time CCC was granted its next set of calls for the channel 47 permit, '''KDLF-TV''' (after the organization's radio station in [[Port Neches, Texas]], now [[KBPO]]). The permit changed hands once again in July 1984, when CCC sold the permit to Television Communications Inc. (owned by local minister Jack Rehburg) for $410,000; Rehburg subsequently planned to call its proposed station '''KTCT''' (for "<u>T</u>ulsa <u>C</u>hristian <u>T</u>elevision," which had served as the branding for KGCT-TV [channel 41, later KTFO and now [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[KMYT-TV]]] when Rehburg maintained a time-leasing agreement with that station from 1984 to 1985).<ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-12-03-OCR-Page-0132.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=79|date=July 2, 1979|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Changing Hands|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-07-16-OCR-Page-0052.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=52|date=July 16, 1984|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-07-16-OCR-Page-0061.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=61|date=July 16, 1984|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref>

After the Rehburg group backed out of the sale, the permit would finally find a buyer who would sign on the station in the fall of 1984, when the permit was sold to [[San Francisco]]-based [[Coit Cleaners|Coit Drapery and Cleaners, Inc.]] Channel 47, as KTCT, first signed on the air on June 3, 1985. Operating as a [[religious broadcasting|religious]] [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]], it originally maintained studio facilities located at East 58th Street and South Garnett Road in southeastern Tulsa ({{convert|0.1|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} east of the then-studio facility of KGCT). Its initial schedule consisted of [[Christian radio|Christian]] programming from the [[PTL Satellite Network]], including shows such as ''[[The PTL Club]]'', ''Heritage Village USA'' and ''[[100 Huntley Street]]'', as well as programs from [[televangelism|televangelists]] such as [[Kenneth Copeland]], [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Jimmy Swaggart]] and [[Richard Roberts (evangelist)|Richard Roberts]]. KTCT suffered from financial problems early on, and reduced its programming schedule to approximately six hours a day by that winter. Coit Drapery and Cleaners opted to put KTCT up for sale there, and wanted to sell the station to a Christian religious broadcast ministry.

===LeSEA ownership===
In April 1986, [[South Bend, Indiana]]-based LeSEA Evangelistic Ministries (eventually rechristened as [[Family Broadcasting Corporation]] in June 2018) – an organization headed by [[Lester Sumrall]] and sons Frank, Phillip and Peter Sumrall – purchased the station from Coit for $3.4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Changing Hands|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/86-OCR/BC-1986-04-14-OCR-Page-0174.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=174|date=April 14, 1986|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=For the Record|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/86-OCR/BC-1986-04-14-OCR-Page-0178.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=178|date=April 14, 1986|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref> After the acquisition was finalized in the fall of 1986, LeSEA changed the station's call letters to '''KWHB''' (standing for "<u>W</u>orld <u>H</u>arvest <u>B</u>roadcasting"). The station initially retained some PTL programming and added other religious programs in the ministry's inventory and original programs (such as ''[[The 700 Club]]'', ''LeSEA Alive'', ''Lester Sumrall Teaches'' and televangelism programs from pastors such as Dwight Thompson, [[Ernest Angley]] and [[Jack Van Impe]]). By 1987, KWHB also added secular family-oriented entertainment programming on weekday afternoons between 2:00 and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. on Saturdays; at the time, it began selling airtime during its secular programming to local and national advertisers to run commercials during program breaks.

After KGCT began a two-year operational cessation in February 1989, in order to allow original owner Green Country Associates to weigh sale offers for the station, KWHB acquired a selection of [[animated cartoon|cartoon shorts and animated series]] that channel 41 previously carried on its schedule. As time went on, KWHB carried a broad mix of various syndicated programs including classic and some recent sitcoms (such as ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet]]'', ''[[Mister Ed]]'', ''[[The Little Rascals]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis The Menace]]'' (both the [[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|live-action sitcom]] and the [[Dennis the Menace (1986 TV series)|animated series]]), ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and ''[[The Cosby Show]]''), westerns (such as ''[[Bonanza]]''), and [[animated cartoon|animated series]] (such as ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Yogi's Gang]]'' and ''[[DuckTales]]''); it also carried a mixture of movies and sporting events on weekends. Televangelist and church service programming by this time typically aired during the prime time and overnight hours and throughout most of its Sunday lineup. Although the station ran a decent amount of general entertainment programming, the Tulsa edition of ''[[TV Guide]]'' never included KWHB in its listings for undisclosed reasons, an unusual situation given that the magazine had provided listings for full-time Christian television stations in its other regional editions.

During the 1990s, KWHB also began producing several local programs such as the [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] program ''47 Family Magazine'', and ministerial programs like ''Life on the Vine'', ''Full Gospel House of Prayer'' and ''Through the Bible with Les Feldick'' (the latter of which was syndicated to other television stations throughout Oklahoma and surrounding states); one such show, the [[Contemporary Christian]] [[music video]] program ''EQ Video'', was syndicated to all eleven television stations that LeSEA owned at that time.<ref name="world-kwhbat10"/> On July 11, 1993, [[Tele-Communications, Inc.]] (TCI) – which, as a byproduct of a corporate breakup tied to [[AT&T]]'s 1999 purchase of TCI, would sell its Tulsa cable franchise to [[Cox Communications]] in February 2000 – began offering KWHB on channel 7, which expanded the station's distribution to cable television subscribers in the Tulsa area; KWHB was one of three Tulsa-area stations (along with KTFO and [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]]-based educational independent KRSC-TV [channel 35, now [[KRSU-TV]]]) to be given clearance on TCI as a result of rules included in the [[Cable Television Protection and Competition Act]] that allowed full-power television stations to elect for [[must-carry|mandatory carriage]] on cable providers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Changing Channels: TCI Cablevision to Shuffle Lineup July 11|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/changing-channels-tci-cablevision-to-shuffle-lineup-july/article_6d77b90b-30d4-52d0-a7cd-5dbd471977e9.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=June 9, 1993|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TCI Cable Channel Lineup Changes Sunday|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tci-cable-channel-lineup-changes-sunday/article_a2b74fb9-1d5f-51e4-bfe9-1c1ca495b7e2.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=July 11, 1993|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>

KWHB became a part-time network affiliate on January 11, 1995, when it initiated a rather informal charter affiliation with [[The WB]] at that network's launch. Channel 47 initially carried the network's family-oriented prime time shows (such as ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[The Parent 'Hood]]'', ''[[Smart Guy]]'' and ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]'') and, beginning with its debut that September, [[animated cartoon|animated series]] from the network's children's program block, [[Kids' WB]], on weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings. However, because of LeSEA Broadcasting's ministerial structure, the strict content guidelines that the group maintained for [[secularity|secular]] programs carried on its stations resulted in KWHB refusing to clear prime time network shows that contained strong profanity, violent or sexual content (such as ''[[Unhappily Ever After]]'', ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'') on the belief that they would offend the sensibilities of channel 47's mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] viewership; these programs were substituted with either ministry and televangelist programs or secular syndicated programs already in LeSEA's inventory or sports. Originally, this was not a significant issue as the pre-empted programs could be seen in the market via the [[superstation]] feed of [[Chicago]] WB affiliate [[WGN-TV]] (now standalone cable channel [[WGN America]]) on most of the area's [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] providers.<ref>{{cite web|title=WB and UPN, Station By Station|url=http://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/97-OCR/BC-1997-07-21-OCR-Page-0008.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=World Radio History|format=PDF|page=6|date=July 21, 1997|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=UVTV dropping WB lineup to air movies, sports|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/uvtv-dropping-wb-lineup-to-air-movies-sports/article_26c7e083-5a46-5f15-8fef-59737e6d9aaf.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=January 30, 1999|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Last night Dawson's last ?

Local cable provider TCI dropped WGN from its lineup on [[New Year's Eve|December 31]], 1996, when WGN, [[The Nashville Network]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] were removed to make room for five channels not previously carried on TCI's Tulsa system ([[Cartoon Network]], [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]], [[Animal Planet]], [[ESPN2]] and [[HGTV]]). While this cut off access to the KWHB-preempted WB programs carried on the superstation feed to TCI's approximately 170,000 subscribers in the Tulsa area, it remained available locally on Heartland Cable Television, [[DirecTV]], [[Dish Network]] and [[PrimeStar]]. WGN was particularly vulnerable to removal as it had lost access to much of the [[Chicago Bulls]]' [[1996–97 Chicago Bulls season|1996–97 game schedule]] due to a dispute between its Tulsa-based distributor, [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|United Video Satellite Group]] (co-founded by Ed Taylor and Roy Bliss, founders of local TCI predecessor Tulsa Cable Television), and the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) over WGN's carriage of the team's telecasts outside of the Chicago market (TCI did not include its Oklahoma systems among those that retained the WGN national feed per an agreement reached with United Video that December, which kept the channel available on TCI in five [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states).<ref>{{cite news|title=WB Joins Network Fray|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/wb-joins-network-fray/article_03e295d4-a64c-55c1-bac4-126708787d81.html|author=Alan Bash|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=January 11, 1995|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Time Warner Takes Crucial Step Toward New Network Television: A pact with superstation WGN-TV gives it access to 73% of homes.

In August 1998, LeSEA Broadcasting and KWHB were fined up to $12,000 by the Federal Communications Commission for exceeded [[Children's Television Act]] advertising limits (which restrict programming time allocated to commercials to 12 minutes per hour on weekdays and 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends) during children's programs that aired on the station a total of 47 times between July 13, 1996 and December 1, 1997. In a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture, the FCC noted that the station noted on its last renewal application that it had exceeded the guidelines by anywhere between 15 and 95 seconds during the cited incidents. The station cited in an application for its prior license renewal that the violations resulted from "inadvertence and/or human error stemming from the failure of KWHB's personnel to detect, over the course of more than a year, a computer error responsible for the commercial overages," and issue that the Commission has "repeatedly rejected" as a reasoning for advertising time violations in the past.<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC fines Tulsa station for violating Children's Act|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/fcc-fines-tulsa-station-for-violating-children-s-act/article_70ecce8b-9140-5cfb-9c9a-dbed25599951.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=August 8, 1998|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> In 2001, KWHB moved to new studio facilities located on South Memorial Drive (north of East 91st Street) in southeastern Tulsa.

On May 4, 1999, transmission lines at KWHB's Coweta transmitter facility were knocked out due to intense [[lightning]] related to severe [[thunderstorm]]s associated with a storm system that produced [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak|66 tornadoes]] across the central third of Oklahoma on May 3. KWHB's signal was taken offline on May 8, due to a steady decrease in power to the transmission lines, as station engineers were preparing to remove and replace the lines and their internal electrical conductors. On that date, TCI regained access to the station at its northeastern Oklahoma [[Cable television headend|headends]] after repairs to the direct [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] studio feed were completed. KWHB's over-the-air signal returned to the air on May 19.<ref>{{cite news|title=KWHB to return to air Wednesday|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/kwhb-to-return-to-air-wednesday/article_0a7082fa-83fa-5d7f-911a-a525091d5312.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=May 19, 1999|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>

By 2012, KWHB had reduced its secular programming slightly (consisting of [[sitcom]]s, [[drama (film and television)|drama series]] and lifestyle programs) to 3:00 to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. each weekday, with a scattering of secular shows airing for a few hours each Saturday and for up to an hour on Sundays, along with a three-hour-long block of children's programs compliant with FCC [[E/I|educational programming guidelines]] on Saturday mornings. In September 2017, following similar scheduling changes at LeSEA's other stations, KWHB was repositioned as a family-oriented entertainment station. Its schedule was revamped to consist mostly of off-network reruns of sitcoms and drama series made from the 1950s to present during the afternoon and evening hours, a late-night block of westerns, and first-run syndicated court and lifestyle shows on weekday early afternoons and weekend afternoons; religious programming was relegated to weekday mornings between 7:30&nbsp;a.m. and noon, but continue to make up the majority of its Sunday lineup.

For the final year of the contract, KWHB carried most of the team's 2004 regular season games, though declining ratings resulted in the station cancelling plans to air the last two scheduled Drillers broadcasts at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news|title=KWHB to air live coverage of Drillers|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/kwhb-to-air-live-coverage-of-drillers/article_4d2c33d7-fc69-52fa-b684-0a2d28d20aa1.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 27, 1999|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tulsa hits the tube|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tulsa-hits-the-tube/article_00feecf7-eacd-52c4-aa6d-a481e227e84b.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 4, 1999|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=KTUL loses its handyman|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/search/?f=html&q=KWHB&s=start_time&sd=desc&l=100&t=article&nsa=eedition&app%5B0%5D=editorial&o=800|author=Matt Doyle|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=August 20, 2004|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>

In April 2001, KWHB obtained the broadcast rights to carry [[AF2]] games involving the [[Tulsa Talons]], beginning with the [[arena football]] league's [[2001 AF2 season|2001 season]]. The station initially aired the Talons' regular season games on a [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] basis; KWHB began to televise several of the team's games live in 2003. Talons co-owner Henry Primeaux cited KWHB's telecasts of the entire 16-game regular season in 2005 in part for helping increasing ticket sales by 14% and raising attendance by 8.3% (an average of 44,722, up from 41,292 in 2004) over the previous year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tiger worth big rating|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tiger-worth-big-rating/article_71afc48a-d6d2-5ff4-84e5-3a53cbab1c58.html|author=Bill Haisten|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=April 13, 2001|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TU duo's chemistry the best|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tu-duo-s-chemistry-the-best/article_74738077-1190-5ca5-8b82-ff8f5f35a7cc.html|author=Matt Doyle|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=August 19, 2005|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tulsa fans' tuning in helps fill home seats|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tulsa-fans-tuning-in-helps-fill-home-seats/article_ece11c76-e2bf-5f0a-8f63-c00153c72ddf.html|author=Mike Brown|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=August 3, 2005|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Talons make deal to broadcast entire season|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/talons-make-deal-to-broadcast-entire-season/article_8e51a04d-aef6-5811-85f6-550fa885087e.html|author=Matt Doyle World|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=March 2, 2005|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> The Talons transferred their local broadcasts exclusively to [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]]-based WB affiliate KWBT (channel 19, now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KQCW-DT]]) for the [[2005 AF2 season|2005 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Talons finalize contracts|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/talons-finalize-contracts/article_f0498f8d-9b8c-59c7-8830-00d126681f40.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=January 20, 2006|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> The Talons returned to channel 47 on a one-time-only basis in August 2007, when it telecast their appearance in that year's [[ArenaCup VIII|ArenaCup]] championship game against the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers]]. (The team's vice president and general manager at that time, Bill Paddock, incidentally served as general manager for KWHB from 1999 to 2005.)<ref>{{cite news|title=Talons' arena2 title game on TV|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/talons-arena-title-game-on-tv/article_5db04c0e-b5df-5603-b952-1bd1972cfa69.html|author=Mike Brown|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=August 22, 2007|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> From 2005 to 2007, the station also carried select regular season and exhibition [[NBA G League|National Basketball Development League]] games involving the Tulsa 66ers (which became the [[Oklahoma City Blue]] upon its relocation downstate to [[Oklahoma City]] in 2014).
