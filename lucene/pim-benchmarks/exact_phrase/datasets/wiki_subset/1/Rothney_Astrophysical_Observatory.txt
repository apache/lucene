The '''Rothney Astrophysical Observatory''' (RAO) is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] located near the hamlet of [[Priddis, Alberta|Priddis]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], about {{Convert|25|km|mi}} southwest of [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]].  The observatory is owned and operated by the [[University of Calgary]] (UC), and was dedicated in 1972.<ref name=AL-RAO />  The facility is used for research, undergraduate and graduate teaching, and public outreach.  Research performed at the RAO included a [[variable star]] search program, follow-up observations of variable star discoveries, and detailed investigation of [[binary star]]s.<ref name=2011WILL /><ref name=2006LENH /><ref name=1997KIJE />  An outstanding minor planet search program was also performed with comet discoveries by Rob Cardinal.<ref>https://www.ucalgary.ca/rao/announcements</ref>  The RAO now participates in many follow-up observation programs, including the Quark Nova project.

==Telescopes==

* The {{Convert|1.8|m|in|abbr=on}} A.R. Cross Telescope (ARCT) is a [[Ritchey-Chrétien telescope|Ritchey-Chrétien]] design dedicated in 1987.<ref name=RAOHIST />  It is attached to an unusual [[telescope mount#Alt-alt (altitude-altitude) mounts|altitude-altitude (alt-alt) mount]] which allows greater access to northern skies than other mounts.<ref name=ARCT />  It was originally equipped with {{Convert|1.5|m|in|abbr=on}} metal mirror acquired many years earlier, but even before the telescope was completed, plans were made to acquire a conventional mirror.<ref name=APO />  This new primary was fabricated in the 1980s and, under a cost-sharing agreement, used from 1990 to 1993 at [[Apache Point Observatory]].  The glass mirror was finally installed in 1996.<ref name=1999MILO /> The telescope is equipped with the Rapid Alternate Detection System (RADS) developed at UC.  The computer-controlled "chopping" of the secondary mirror enables observers to perform [[Photometry (astronomy)|differential photometry]] with the telescope.
* The {{Convert|0.5|m|in|abbr=on}} Baker-Nunn Telescope was built in 1957 and donated in 1981 to RAO by the [[Canadian Forces Base]] [[CFB Cold Lake|Cold Lake]]. It is a modified [[Cassegrain telescope|Cassegrain reflector]] which was used to track satellites under a [[United States Air Force]] program.<ref name=RAOHIST />  The original [[telescope mount#Alt-alt (altitude-altitude) mounts|altitude-altitude-azimuth mount]] was replaced with a simpler [[equatorial mount]] when the telescoped was refurbished in 2004.<ref name=1982MILO /> [[DFM Engineering]] performed the work with the help of UC.<ref name=DFM-BN />
* The {{Convert|0.4|m|in|abbr=on}} Clark-Milone Telescope (CMT), named after former co-directors Alan Clark and [[Eugene Milone]], was installed at RAO in 1972.<ref name=04CM />  It was used to develop RADS in the early 1980s.<ref name=1983MILO />
