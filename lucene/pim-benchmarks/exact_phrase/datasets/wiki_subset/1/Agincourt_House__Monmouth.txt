'''Agincourt House''', No. 1 Agincourt Square, [[Monmouth]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]] is a notable early seventeenth century half-timbered building.{{sfn|Newman|p=405}}  

==History==
The building has been much restored, but the [[bargeboard]] over the gable onto Agincourt Square gives a date of 1624. {{sfn|Newman|p=405}}  The initials on either side of the date are those of William Roberts, whose grandson rebuilt [[Drybridge House, Monmouth|Drybridge House]] in Monmouth.   Agincourt House is [[Grade II*]] listed as at 27 June 1952.<ref>[http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-2223-agincourt-house-monmouth Agincourt House], British Listed Buildings, accessed 25 January 2012</ref>  It is one of 24 buildings on the [[Monmouth Heritage Trail]].

A house on the site is shown on [[John Speed]]'s map of Monmouth Town dated 1610, the street plan on which was to remain unaltered until the 19th century.  The present shop frontage is late nineteenth century.<ref>[http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/36360/details/AGINCOURT+SQUARE+NO+1+%26+1A/ Agincourt House 1 and 1a], Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments, accessed 25 January 2012</ref>  From around 1830 to the end of the 19th century it was an Ironmongers.  In 1830 the proprietor was Josiah Coates, who was also a Blacksmith, Brazier, and Tinplate Worker.  From the early 1860s to 1883 the proprietor was Joseph Coates, with the words 'Furnishing' and 'Ironmonger' on the shop fascia to either side of the name 'Coates'.  He also undertook the duties of Blacksmith, but he was also a Nailmaker, Locksmith, and Bellhanger.  Joseph Coates (d. 1883) was a Chorister and Church Warden at [[St Mary's Priory Church, Monmouth|St Mary's Priory Church]].  It is said that [[John Major]], the UK Prime Minister 1990-7, is a descendant of the Coates family.

From 1884 the premises were occupied by another Ironmonger, namely William Honeyfield, who was a very prominent citizen in Monmouth and was [[Mayor of Monmouth]] 1891â€“95.  He was also a [[Freemason|Mason]] and a member of the Bellringers at St Mary's Priory Church, and took part in a 10-part Peal of Bells recorded on a Plaque in the Bell Tower (Thursday July 1, 1896).

In 1919 the premises were occupied by the [[YMCA]], and in the early 1920s by Cash & Co. (Boot and Shoe Makers).  The name Cash & Co. may still be seen in the mosaic floor to the front entrance doorway.  By 1934 the premises had been taken over by W. & E. Turner Ltd., Shoe Retailer.  'Le Gourmet', the butchers currently in Church Street, occupied the shop in the 1980s when it closed as a Shoe Retailer.  After the butchers moved out the premises were extensively restored and were given an award by Monmouth Civic Society on 16 October 1991.  From 1992 up to March 2010 the premises were an Antiques Shop, and it is now (2012) a clothes shop, with offices on the upper floors.
