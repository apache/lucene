*20: For the first time in 62 basho (since [[Kotomitsuki]]'s victory in September 2001) the yusho is not won by a yokozuna or an ozeki. The final day of the Natsu basho sees three co–leaders on 11–3, maegashira [[Kyokutenho]] and [[Tochiozan]], and ozeki [[Kisenosato]]. Kyokutenho beats [[Goeido]] and Tochiozan gets a default win over the withdrawing [[Kotooshu]], but Kisenosato, who led by two wins earlier in the tournament, is defeated by fellow ozeki Baruto and is out of contention. Kyokutenho then defeats Tochiozan in a playoff&nbsp;– the first ever between two maegashira&nbsp;– and at 37 years and 8 months becomes the oldest ever first–time yusho winner, and second oldest yusho winner ever (behind only [[Tachiyama]] in 1916). Kyokutenho had originally been due to retire and take over Oshima stable before this tournament, but decided to continue wrestling. He receives his sixth Fighting Spirit Award, shared with Tochiozan, while Goeido gets his first Outstanding performance Award for defeating Hakuho on Day 8. The Technique Award is won for the second time by Myogiryu. In the jūryō division [[Tamaasuka]] wins his second yusho. This tournament also sees former [[komusubi]] [[Kakizoe]] and former maegashira {{Interlanguage link multi|Tsurugidake Teruki|ja|3=剣武輝希|lt=Tsurugidake}} announce their retirements.
*20: The [[Hanakago stable]] closes, with its wrestlers and stablemaster, former sekiwake [[Daijuyama]], moving to [[Minezaki stable]].
*22: The Sumo Association announce two promotions to jūryō. Mongolian [[Takanoiwa]] becomes [[Takanohana]]'s first sekitori since he took over his stable in 2004, and fellow Mongolian {{Interlanguage link multi|Oniarashi Chkara|ja|3=鬼嵐力|lt=Oniarashi}} of [[Asahiyama stable]] finally reaches jūryō after 71 tournaments, the slowest rise ever by a foreign recruit.
*27: The retirement ceremony of former ozeki [[Kaio Hiroyuki|Kaio]], who ended his career in July 2011, takes place at the Kokugikan, with around 10000 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sumo: Former ozeki Kaio has topknot removed in emotional ceremony |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120528p2g00m0sp030000c.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Au4gWAn?url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120528p2g00m0sp030000c.html |publisher=Mainichi Weekly |archivedate=4 June 2012 |date=28 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===June===
*25: The banzuke for the July tournament is released. Myogiryu makes his san'yaku debut at komusubi, and despite his victory in the last tournament Kyokutenho remains in the magashira ranks&nbsp;– the first time a maegashira yusho winner has not been promoted to san'yaku since [[Sadanoyama]] in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 July Grand Sumo Tournament Banzuke Topics |url=http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/hon_basho/topics/banzuke_topics.html |publisher=Sumo Association |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69yTUfRKr?url=http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/hon_basho/topics/banzuke_topics.html |archivedate=17 August 2012 |date=June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The jūryō championship is won by Chiyonokuni, a great comeback after missing some or all of his last three tournaments. The retirement of former ''juryo'' and [[Nippon Sport Science University]] competitor [[Chiyozakura Ukyo|Chiyozakura]] is confirmed. He had missed the previous three tournaments due to a [[cervical spine]] injury suffered the previous year. His career was so brief that despite reaching ''[[sekitori]]'' status he never had the chance to have his hair put in the ''[[oichomage]]'' style.

===August===
*27: The banzuke for the forthcoming Aki basho is released. Myogiryu makes his sekiwake debut, and Aoiyama his komusubi debut. {{Interlanguage link multi|Asahishō|ja|3=旭日松広太}} is promoted to makuuchi. New sekitori are {{Interlanguage link multi|Keitenkai|ja|3=慶天海孔晴}}, and college champions {{Interlanguage link multi|Daikiho Masahiro|ja|3=大喜鵬雅弘|lt=Daikiho}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Tanzo Takahiro|ja|3=丹蔵隆浩|lt=Tanzo}}.

Sekiwake Myogiryu scores 10–5 and wins his fourth Technique prize in five tournaments. Tochiozan gets the Outstanding Performance award for his win over Hakuho. There is no Fighting Spirit prize awarded, although Kyokutenho, who won his first nine bouts, would have received it had he won on the final day.<ref name=yokozuna/> The jūryō championship is won by Jokoryu, who secures promotion to the top division after just nine tournaments as a pro&nbsp;– the fastest rise since the introduction of six tournaments a year in 1958.

*1: Harumafuji wins the first day of the All Japan sumo tournament, defeating Kisenosato in the final. It is his fourth one-day title, matching the record held by [[Futabayama Sadaji|Futabayama]] and [[Akebono Taro|Akebono]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Harumafuji a winner in yokozuna debut|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ss20121002a1.html|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=1 October 2012}}</ref>

The autumn tour visits the following locations:
*6: Nagano, Nagano Prefecture
*7: Fujioka, Gunma Prefecture
*13: Saitama, Saitama Prefecture
*14: Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture
*20: Uozu, Toyama Prefecture

*23: Shodoshima, Kagawa Prefecture
*25: Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture
*26: Seiyo, Ehime Prefecture
*27: Hiroshima, Hiroshima Prefecture

* 29: The banzuke for the forthcoming Kyūshū basho is released.  Harumafuji is listed as West Yokozuna; Aminishiki and Hōmashō return to ''komusubi'' rank, with Aoiyama losing the rank; Jōkōryū is the sole debutant in the Makuuchi division, with Ikioi, Chiyonokuni, Yoshiazuma, and Tamawashi all returning; Ryūden's Jūryō debut is accompanied by the return of Kyokushūhō, Akiseyama, Homarefuji, and Masakaze.  In addition, the 10th Kimura Shōzaburō, the gyōji who was knocked out in the January basho, is promoted to become the 39th [[Shikimori Inosuke]].

===November===
*1: The Sumo Association says that it has received an application for just one new recruit for the forthcoming tournament. That means a total for the year of just 56, the lowest since the six tournaments a year system was established in 1958.<ref name="low">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/01/sumo-recruitment-low-japan|title=Sumo recruitment hits 54-year low in Japan|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=1 November 2012|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> 34 of those entered at the end of the Japanese school year in March, the lowest since 1973.<ref name="low"/>
*25: At the Kyushu basho, Hakuho wins just his second championship of the year, but 23rd of his career, and for good measure defeats his fellow yokozuna Harumafuji for the first time since March. Hakuho finishes on 14–1, three wins ahead of sekiwake Goeido, who wins the Technique Award, and rank and filer Toyonoshima. Harumafuji can only score 9–6 and loses his last five bouts, the first debut yokozuna ever to do so. Hakuho′s victory is his sixth straight in Kyushu, and he also ensures that for the sixth year in a row he has the most wins of any rikishi, with 76, although this is well down on the record of 86 he set in 2009 and 2010. There are several withdrawals through injury, including Baruto who loses his ozeki status as a result. Kotooshu and Kotoshogiku however, maintain their ranks with 9–6 and 8–7 respectively. [[Shōhōzan Yūya|Shōhōzan]] wins the Fighting Spirit Award for his strong performance at maegashira 2. In the Juryo division, [[Tochinowaka Michihiro|Tochinowaka]] races to a 13–0 lead but then loses his last two bouts and misses out on the yusho, which goes to [[Sadanofuji Akihiro|Sadanofuji]] on 14–1.
* 26: After a meeting of the [[Yokozuna Deliberation Council]] at the Kokugikan, its chairman Takuhiko Tsuruta criticises Harumafuji′s 9–6 performance as unacceptable, saying "as a yokozuna, you at least have to be able to get double digits wins, or you don't qualify." He even suggests the Council may have erred in recommending Harumafuji for promotion&nbsp;– "His poor performance leaves us with the feeling that we might have promoted him too quickly."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ss20121127a1.html|title=Harumafuji under fire|date=27 November 2012|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref>

===December===
* 24: The banzuke for the forthcoming January tournament is released.  Baruto is relegated to sekiwake; Myōgiryū, Aminishiki, and Hōmashō lose san'yaku status, while Tochiōzan and Shōhōzan are promoted to komusubi, and Takarafuji, Tamaasuka, Kotoyūki, Sadanofuji, and Tochinowaka are promoted to makuuchi.  Shironoryū's return to jūryō is accompanied by the debuts of Azumaryū and Kagamiō and the relegations of Asasekiryū, Wakakōyū, Jōkōryū, Chiyonokuni, and Yoshiazuma, while Kitaharima, Ryūden, and Masakaze lose sekitori status altogether.
