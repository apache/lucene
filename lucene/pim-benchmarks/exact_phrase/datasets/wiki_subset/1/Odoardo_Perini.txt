'''Odoardo Perini''' (5 April 1671 – 29 December 1757) was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter of the late-[[Baroque]] period, active in [[Verona]].

==Biography==
He first apprenticed with  [[Andrea Voltolino]].  He then trained in Bologna under [[Giovanni Maria Viani]]. He painted a series of canvases of classical stories for the Count Ercole Giusti. He painted some religious canvases for the Colombini in Bologna. He was described by [[Carlo Ridolfi]] as having a ‘’very strange brain’’<ref>’’Questo pittore fu di un cervello bizzarro assai’’, Ridolfi, page 37.</ref> with his paintings equally strange.

The Fondazione Cariverona has a Perini canvas depicting ''Tancredo al campo crociato piange la morte di Clorinda'' (Tancred in the Crusader camp mourns the death of Clorinda), a work once part of series of depictions of ''Gerusalemma Liberata'' owned by Count Ercole Giusti in his Veronese palace. The series included a work each by Perini, [[Carl Loth]], [[Antonio Bellucci]], [[Antonio Fumiani]], [[Gregorio Lazzarini]], and [[Simone Brentana]]. Also on display in the same hall were two mythological subjects by also by Loth, and five landscapes by [[Giovanni Ruggieri]].<ref>[http://www.academia.edu/16572167/Odoardo_Perini_Tancredi_e_Clorinda [[Louis Dorigny]] (1654-1742), Un pittore della corte francese a Verona], monograph for 2003 exhibition at Museo de Castelvecchio, Verona, curated by Paola and Giorgio Marini, pageds 123-125.</ref>
