*'''Comment''' - don't you think it would be a good idea to advise the [[WP:IE|Ireland project]] that this is up for deletion? [[User:Fmph|Fmph]] ([[User talk:Fmph|talk]]) 09:00, 19 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - Why would you bring up a discussion and not involve the Ireland project and still, while in discussion just go ahead and remove it anyway without any decision to do so. Is this discussion mechanism even taken seriously by those allegedly voting on it? In particular I have noted Frietjes and 174.56.57.138 of such actions. You should also note that I have not voted either way as no good case has been put forward for/against. [[User:DubhEire|DubhEire]] ([[User talk:DubhEire|talk]]) 10:36, 19 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - I've looked into this further and I can see that there were edits to the ''Infobox Irish school'' by Frietjes. I can't determine the reason for the edits, but I can presume it was to simplify the template in order to compare with ''Infobox School''. So in that case comparing both templates I can see that ''Infobox School'' holds every field that ''Infobox Irish school'' has. ''Infobox Irish school'' perhaps was trying to make it easier to specify Irish schooling year names, considering both templates were started in 2005. But this would be dealt with in a generic way in ''Infobox School'' and led by the examples in the documentation, and I'm sure by actual usage in articles.
: But I am still interested in the reason for the hasty removal. The reasoning is very compact and light. It would appear to be an open shut case in hindsight, but perhaps hold your horses just a bit and bring some people in. So in that case
* '''Delete''', but it's already been eradicated. [[User:DubhEire|DubhEire]] ([[User talk:DubhEire|talk]]) 21:09, 19 January 2012 (UTC)

The template lists random websites mostly unrelated to each other, in a way other than "all being wikis", contradicting [[WP:NAVBOX]]: "The articles should refer to each other, to a reasonable extent.". [[WP:NAV]] suggests that "If the articles are not established as related by reliable sources in the actual articles, then it is probably not a good idea to interlink them."
