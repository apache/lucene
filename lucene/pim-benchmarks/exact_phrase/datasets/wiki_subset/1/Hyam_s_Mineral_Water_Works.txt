==History==
A [[mineral water]] works, for the manufacture of soda water, lemonade and ginger beer, was established in [[Glendower Street, Monmouth|Glendower Street]] in 1866 by Thomas E. Hyam, a leading figure in nineteenth century Monmouth.  He was a corn and timber merchant, saw mill owner, and shop owner, who became [[Mayor of Monmouth|Monmouth's mayor]] in 1875/6 and was also a [[Justice of the Peace]].  To quote Keith Kissack,<ref>Kissack K (1986)  Victorian Monmouth  {{ISBN|0-9503386-2-1}}  Monmouth Historical and Educational Trust, Monmouth</ref> "No committee or association was considered complete unless it included his name". Residences in Monmouth associated with the Hyam family were Cornwall House in Monnow Street and Parade House on North Parade. In 1870, the [[Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort|Duke of Beaufort]] commended his mineral waters, writing:<blockquote>"For upwards of six months I have used no [[Seltzer water]] but Mr Hyam's of Monmouthâ€¦ I have found it most excellent.  I have never been so well supplied."<ref name=mcs>Monmouth Civic Society, ''Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail'', n.d., p.24</ref></blockquote>  In 1895 [[Kelly's Directory]] of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] for 1901 describes John B Hyam's business as "mineral & aerated water manufacturer & ale & porter merchant."<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~familyalbum/kmon6.htm  Kelly's Directory 1901, Monmouth]</ref>   About this time proprietary medicines became popular and were advertised in the ''[[Monmouthshire Beacon]]'', amongst which was 'Hyam's Anti-Influenza Tonic Water'.

Hyam owned a saw mill and timber yard at Wyesham, and owned boats known as trows for hauling his timber and carrying goods on the River Wye. He also had a retail shop at 33, Monnow Street, designed by Lawrence of Newport and built by Lewis of Monmouth in 1866. The new building of freestone with Aberdeen granite pillars was widely praised at the time. The spandrels were elaborately carved and it was one of the first shops in Monmouth to introduce curved plate glass windows. The premises are, in 2012, occupied by a kitchenware and gifts retailer.

In 1911 the business was taken over by Charles Ballinger, and traded as Ballinger's Mineral Water Works until the 1960s. Ballinger was also the landlord of the [[The Griffin, Monmouth|Griffin Hotel]] in [[Whitecross Street, Monmouth|Whitecross Street]].  He traded as a Mineral Water Manufacturer and bottler of Bass and Worthington's Ales, Guinness Stout and Wheatley's Hop Bitters.<ref>advert in the ''Monmouthshire Beacon'', December 1914)</ref>  This continued until the 1960s when the firm closed down. The premises were then occupied by Ebley Ltd., a tyre company,
who subsequently relocated to the Mayhill Industrial Estate, and the buildings on Glendower Street were converted into apartments and named Hyam Court.<ref name=mcs/>
