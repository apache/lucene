MCP began life as Empire Academy, a similarly formatted school which suddenly and unexpectedly closed its doors during the school year. Parents of students who were attending Empire banded together to form a new school, MCP becoming the result. After a brief stint in a location on Encinal street, they moved to Fern street after the discovery of mold in the previous building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/general-news/20100419/empire-academy-reborn-as-monterey-coast-prep|title=Empire Academy reborn as Monterey Coast Prep|date=2010-04-19|website=Santa Cruz Sentinel|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> Eventually, they would move to their current location, 125 Bethany Drive.
