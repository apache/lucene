'''Barbara''' ({{lang-ar|برْبره}}) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] village in the [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|Gaza Subdistrict]] located 17&nbsp;km northeast of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] city, in the vicinity of modern [[Ashkelon]]. It had an entirely Arab population of 2,410 in 1945. The village consisted of nearly 14,000 [[dunam|dunum]]s of which approximately 12,700 dunums was able to be cultivated. It was captured by [[Israel]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].

==History==
Barbara received its modern name from the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. After the Roman rule the village was under the control of a number of empires and dynasties ranging from the [[Byzantine]]s, various [[Islamic]] Arab dynasties, the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Mamluk]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and [[United Kingdom]].

Archeological building and pottery remains from  the Late  [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods have been excavated here. Coins minted under [[Nero]],  [[Valentinian II]],  [[Theodosius I]], [[Justin I]] and [[Justinian I]] were also found.<ref name=Nikolsky2013>Nikolsky, 2013, [http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=2204&mag_id=120 Horbat Barbarit]</ref> A winepress, dating from the Byzantine period has been found.<ref>Haimi, 2008, [http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=751&mag_id=114  Mavqi‘im Final Report]</ref>

A coin, dating from the  [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] (697–750 CE) era has also been found here<ref name=Nikolsky2013/>

According to the Arab geographer [[Mujir al-Din]] (1456–1522), the village was home to the [[Muslim]] [[scholarly method|scholar]] sheikh ''Yusuf al-Barbarawi'', a local sage and a student of renowned scholar ''Ahmad ibn Dawud'', who died in 1323.<ref>Al-Khalidi 1968:84, and D 1/2:255, fn. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 81.</ref>

===Ottoman period===
During the reign of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Murad III]] (1574-1596), Barbara's only mosque was built. It contained the tomb of ''Yusuf al-Barbarawi''.<ref name=Khalidi81>Khalidi, 1992, p. 81</ref> In the 1596  [[Defter|tax registers]], Barbara was part of the ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistrict) of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] under the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa']]'' (district) of [[Gaza Sanjak|Gaza]]. It had a population of  with a population of 73 [[Muslim]] households, an estimated 402 persons. They paid a fixed sum of 17,000 [[akçe]] in tax, where all the revenue went to a [[Waqf|Muslim charitable endowment]].<ref>Hütteroth and  Abdulfattah, 1977,  p. 151. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 81</ref>

The village appeared under the  name of ''Hababeh'' on the map that [[Pierre Jacotin]] compiled in 1799.<ref>Karmon, 1960, p. [http://www.jchp.ucla.edu/Bibliography/Karmon,_Y_1960_Jacotin_Map_(IEJ_10).pdf  173]</ref>

In 1838, [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] noted ''Burbarah'' as a Muslim village, located  in the Gaza district.<ref name=Robinson118>Robinson and Smith, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/118/mode/1up 118]</ref>

In May 1863, the French explorer [[Victor Guérin]] visited the village. He estimated it had 400 inhabitants. He further noted a  [[wali]], dedicated to a Sheik Yusuf, with sections of ancient  white-grey [[marble]] [[column]]s. Further five -six sections of marble column were observed around the well.<ref>Guérin, 1869, pp.
[https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog02gu#page/172/mode/1up 172] -173</ref> [[Albert Socin|Socin]] found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870  that  Barbara had a total of 113 houses and a population of 372, though the population count included men only.<ref>Socin, 1879, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde01deut#page/144/mode/1up  144]</ref>  [[Martin Hartmann|Hartmann]]  found that Barbara  had 112  houses.<ref>Hartmann, 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_BZobAQAAIAAJ#page/n938/mode/1up  130]</ref>

In 1883  the [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s ''[[PEF Survey of Palestine|Survey of Western Palestine]]'' described Barbara as a village rectangular in shape and surrounded by gardens and two ponds. The sand encroaching from the coast was stopped by the cactus hedges of the gardens. To the east of the village there were olive groves.<ref>Conder and Kitchener, 1883, III: [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/259/mode/1up p.259]. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.81</ref>

A building, dating to the late Ottoman, or early  British Mandate era have been excavated.<ref>Haimi, 2016, [http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=25109&mag_id=124   Horbat Barbarit]</ref>

===British Mandate of Palestine===
In the [[1922 census of Palestine]] conducted by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate authorities]], Barbara had a population of 1,369 inhabitants, all [[Muslim]]s,<ref name="Census1922">Barron, 1923,  Table V, Sub-district of Gaza, p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n10/mode/1up   8]</ref> which had increased in  the [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]]  to 1546, still all Muslim, in 318 houses.<ref name="Census1931">Mills, 1932, p. [https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas  2]</ref>

In the [[Village Statistics, 1945|1945 statistics]]  the population of Barbara consisted of  2,410 Muslims<ref name=1945p31/> and the  land area was 13,978  [[dunam]]s, according to an official land and population survey.<ref name=Hadawi45/>  Of this, 132 dunams were designated for  citrus and bananas, 
2,952 for plantations and irrigable land, 9,615 for cereals,<ref>Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. ''Village Statistics, April, 1945.'' Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20II/Gaza/Page-086.jpg 86]</ref> while 70 dunams were built-up areas.<ref>Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. ''Village Statistics, April, 1945.'' Quoted in  Hadawi,  1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20III/Gaza/Page-136.jpg 136]</ref>

At the end of the Mandate Period, the above-mentioned mosque, built late 1500, was still standing, and in addition the village center contained a number of shops. An elementary school was founded in 1921, and by 1947 it had 252 students. Barbara was also known for its long rugs, ''al-mazawid,'' which were woven by the women of the village.<ref name=Khalidi81/>

===1948 War===
Barbara was captured by a possible combination of the [[Negev Brigade|Negev]], [[Giv'ati Brigade|Giv'ati]] and [[Yiftach Brigade|Yiftach]] brigades on November 5, 1948 during [[Operation Yoav]]. At the end of November 1948, Coastal Plain District troops carried  out  sweeps of the villages around and to the south of [[Al-Majdal, Askalan|Majdal]]. Barbara was one of the villages named in the orders to the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] battalions and engineers platoon, that the villagers were to be  expelled to Gaza, and the IDF troops were "to prevent their return by destroying their villages." The path leading to the village was to be mined. The IDF troops were ordered to carry out the operation "with determination, accuracy and energy".<ref>Coastal  Plain District HQ to battalions 151 and ´1 Volunteers`, etc., 19:55 hours, 25 Nov. 1948, IDFA (=Israeli Defence Forces and Defence Ministry Archive) 6308\49\\141. Cited in Morris, 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&pg=PA517 517]</ref> The operation took place on 30 November. The troops found "about 40" villagers in Barbara and [[al-Jiyya]], "composed of women, old men and children", who offered no resistance.  They were expelled to [[Beit Hanun]], in the northern Gaza strip. Eight young men who were found were sent to a [[POW]] camp.<ref>Coastal Plain  HQ to Southern Front\Operations, 30 Nov. 1948, IDFA 1978\50\\1; and Southern Front\Operations to General Staff Divisions, 2. Dec. 1948, IDFA 922\75\\1025. Cited in Morris, 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&pg=PA518 518]</ref>

Following the war the area was incorporated into the [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the [[moshav]]im of [[Mavki'im]] and [[Talmei Yafeh]] were established on the former village's land. According to the Palestinian historian [[Walid Khalidi]] (1992), the village remaining structures on the village land are: 
<blockquote>''"The crumbled walls and debris of houses are all that remains of the village buildings. The debris is overgrown with thorns and brush. Old eucalyptus and sycamore trees and cactuses also grow on the site. Some of the old streets are clearly identifiable. One area of the site serves as a garbage dump and a junkyard for old cars. The surrounding lands are planted by Israeli farmers in corn."''<ref name=Khalidi82/></blockquote>
