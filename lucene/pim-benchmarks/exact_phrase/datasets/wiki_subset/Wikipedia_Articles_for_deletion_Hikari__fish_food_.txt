*This article does not assert its notability under [[WP:CORP]]. Vaguely advertisement like. If notability cannot be established by then end of the AfD discussion I recommend the article be '''deleted'''. [[User:MidgleyDJ|MidgleyDJ]] 01:23, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', Google turns up a [[Financial Times]] article about the company, which isn't loading at the moment, but indicates they have been the subject of nontrivial media coverage.  This isn't just some small business promoting itself. [[User:Night Gyr|Night Gyr]] ([[User talk:Night Gyr|talk]]/[[User:Night Gyr/Over|Oy]]) 02:05, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

*Hikari is a company notable in Japan for producing innovative specialty fish food and ornamental fish.Dragonbite 02:00, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*Hikari is even being used in Ranchu breeding by Dr. Erik L. Johnson, D.V.M., author of Fancy Goldfish: A Complete Guide to Care and Collecting. Dr. Johnson is a world-renowned veterinarian with clinical specialty in fish medicine. He is also the author of the book/producer of videotape "Koi Health and Disease".Dragonbite 02:04, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', kindly read [http://www.aquarama.com.sg/aquaramamagazine/advertisernews1.html Article on Kamihata Fish Industries Group (Hikari), Aquarama Magazine (Asia), October 2006, Issue 7][[User:Rodsan18|Dragonbite]] 03:46, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' as per above, but the article needs to be better referenced than it is.  [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] 05:03, 19 May 2007 (UTC).
*'''Keep''', definitely seems notable enough by now, given the notable sources popping up. (Mmm... fish...) [[User:TenPoundHammer|<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Ten&nbsp;Pound&nbsp;Hammer</span>]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;<sup>((([[Special:Contributions/TenPoundHammer|Broken&nbsp;clamshells]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[:User talk:TenPoundHammer|Otter&nbsp;chirps]])))</sup> 05:43, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' plenty of refs and external links to prove notability. Consider renaming it though, the (fish food) suggests that Hikari ''is'' fish food, not a company that makes fish food. <font color="maroon">[[User:Mr.Z-man|Mr.Z-man]]</font>'''<small>[[User talk:Mr.Z-man|talk]]</small>''<font color="navy" face="cursive">[[Special:Contributions/Mr.Z-man|¢]]</font>''''' 20:00, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. As a brand catering to hobbyists who have an extensive literature on their hobby, it should not be hard to find even more independent and reliable sources that discuss this product line. - [[User:Ihcoyc|Smerdis of Tlön]] 21:12, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''COmment''' might be better to move to the name of the company, to allow for discussion of all their lines of products. [[User:Night Gyr|Night Gyr]] ([[User talk:Night Gyr|talk]]/[[User:Night Gyr/Over|Oy]]) 21:51, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', the notability is backed with many references, but the long list on the article needs to be taken care of. '''''[[User:Cremepuff222|<font color="008000">*Cremepuff</font>]][[User talk:Cremepuff222|<font color="006400">222*</font>]]''''' 23:28, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', subject notability is backed with many solid references. [[User:FlamingSpear|FlamingSpear]] 23:36, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' There are sources affirming notability. I think the article could use some work to make it more NPOV.
