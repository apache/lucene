'''Lyon Lake''' is a small, natural lake in [[Fredonia Township, Michigan|Fredonia Township]], [[Calhoun County, Michigan|Calhoun County]], [[Michigan]]. The lake is approximately {{convert|3/4|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1/4|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide ({{convert|125|acre|abbr=on}}). The lake is part of a small cluster of lakes {{convert|6|mi|abbr=on}} south of the historic village of [[Marshall, Michigan]]. The other lakes are Fish Lake, Pine Lake and Long Lake.

Lyon Lake is surrounded by predominately modest residential homes that are the primary residences of the homeowners. The southern shore of the lake is adjacent to the Marshall Country Club, which is a  private golf course.

Lyon Lake is named after [[Lucius Lyon]], who was a prominent [[Surveying|land surveyor]] in the [[Michigan Territory]] in the early 1830s and among the most influential men in the process of establishing [[U.S. state|statehood]]. Lucius Lyon served Michigan as both [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House Representative]].
