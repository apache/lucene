The release came well after the CFL free agency period had passes, leading Elimimian's agent to criticize [[Ed Hervey]] for the timing; Elimimian had already agreed to pay cuts in consecutive years so that he could remain with the Lions, and with his release this late, Elimimian's next contract would not be as high given that most team's had already committed resources for the season.<ref>https://3downnation.com/2019/05/05/solomon-elimimians-agent-acuses-lions-gm-ed-hervey-of-shady-business/</ref> Hervey doubled down on his reasons for releasing Elimimian; "We know when a players’ time is up and that's the decision that we made."<ref>https://3downnation.com/2019/05/21/lions-gm-ed-hervey-on-elimimian-we-know-when-a-players-time-is-up/</ref>

===Saskatchewan Roughriders===
On May 9, 2019, the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] signed Elimimian to a contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/saskatchewan-roughriders-sign-linebacker-solomon-elimimian-to-contract-1.1303104|title=Roughriders sign LB Elimimian to contract|date=May 9, 2019|website=TSN|access-date=May 9, 2019}}</ref> Elimimian missed the first three games, but proved himself effective by finishing third in defensive tackles with 88, which was good for first in the Western Division, for which he was named a divisional All-Star.<ref>https://www.cfl.ca/2019/11/06/2019-cfl-division-stars-announced/</ref> He also forced a fumble, and had 4 sacks; in three wins against Hervey's BC Lions, Elimimian had one sack in each of them. Elimimian helped lead the Roughriders to first place in the West Division for the first time in a decade.

==Canadian Football League Players' Association==
On February 7, 2020, Elimimian was elected President of the [[Canadian Football League Players' Association]], beating out three other candidates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Riders' Solomon Elimimian elected as new president of CFL Players' Association |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/linebacker-solomon-elimimian-elected-president-cfl-players-association-1.5478852 |website=CBC |publisher=Canadian Press |accessdate=20 February 2020}}</ref> He succeeded [[Jeff Keeping]] who did not seek a second term.
