(film)|Please Sir!]]'' (1971) and the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] sitcom ''[[For the Love of Ada]]'' (1970–71) amongst others, before he landed the role for which he is best known – that of bigoted socialist and union leader, 'brother' Eddie Booth in ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]''. The programme ran for eight series between 1972 and 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/501026/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Love Thy Neighbour (1972–76)|website=www.screenonline.org.uk}}</ref> During this run he also appeared in the 1974 film version of the sitcom ''[[Man About the House]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6afac5af|title=Man about the House (1974)|work=bfi.org.uk}}</ref> He reprised his role as Eddie Booth for the 1979 sequel ''[[Love Thy Neighbour in Australia]]''.

After ''Love Thy Neighbour'' ended, his film appearances have been few and far between, but include ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981), the [[John Goodman]] vehicle ''[[King Ralph]]'' (1991) (which re-united him with his ''Love Thy Neighbour'' co-star [[Rudolph Walker]]) and 1996's ''La Passione''.<ref name=bfi/>

He has played four different characters in ''[[Coronation Street]]'': a brewery drayman in 1961, and in January 1967 Percy Bridge, who tried to con Elsie Tanner.
