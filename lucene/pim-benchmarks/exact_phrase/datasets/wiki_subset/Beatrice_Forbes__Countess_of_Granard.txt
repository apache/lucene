==Thoroughbred racing==
Beatrice Mills was raised around horses at her family's [[Staatsburgh State Historic Site|Livingston Mansion]] in [[Staatsburg, New York]]. Her father owned [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|racehorses]] in the United States and in [[France]] in partnership with [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Edward, Earl of Derby]]. Beatrice's sister Gladys and her brother Ogden would establish [[Wheatley Stable]] that would become one of the preeminent Thoroughbred racing and breeding operations in the United States.

Beatrice's husband, Bernard, was [[Master of the Horse#The United Kingdom Master of the Horse|Master of the Horse]] whose duties for [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] included overseer of the [[Royal Mews|Royal Stables]] and [[Stud farm|Stud]]. On January 29, 1929, Beatrice's father died. As part of her inheritance she received his stable of Thoroughbreds in France. That year, she led all owners in purses earned.

In 1933, her horse, [[Cappiello]], won the [[Prix Lupin]] and the prestigious [[Grand Prix de Paris]] at [[Longchamp Racecourse]] in Paris.<ref name="GrandPrix1933">{{cite news |title=$50,000 GRAND PRIX TAKEN BY CAPPIELLO; Lady Granard's Horse Triumphs at Longchamps -- Lebrun Is Among Spectators. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/06/26/105148803.pdf |accessdate=27 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 26, 1933 |language=en}}</ref>  Among her other racing successes, Lady Granard's horses won the [[Prix Jacques le Marois]] in 1937 and 1967. In 1964 her horse [[Pourparler (horse)|Pourparler]] won the [[British Classic Races|British Classic]], the [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]].

The most notable horse bred and raced by her siblings [[Wheatley Stable]] in the United States was [[Bold Ruler]], a [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] inductee and an eight-time [[Leading sire in North America]]. Gladys and Ogden bred Bold Ruler to the Champion racing mare, [[Misty Morn]]. The result of the mating was [[Bold Lad]], a [[Colt (horse)|colt]] born in 1962 that earned [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] honors. Bold Ruler sired a second colt in 1964 by a different mare that was given the same Bold Lad name. [[Bold Lad II]] was bred by Lady Granard and raced in England and Ireland where it too won Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1966/06/15/archives/a-new-bold-lad-scores-at-ascot-irishtrained-2yearold-takes-coventry.html Bold Lad II profile], nytimes.com; accessed 26 March 2016.</ref>
