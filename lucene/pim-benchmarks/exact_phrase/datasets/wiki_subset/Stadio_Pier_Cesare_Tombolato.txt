'''Stadio Pier Cesare Tombolato''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Cittadella]], [[Italy]]. It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[A.S. Cittadella]]. The stadium holds 7,623.

==History==
The stadium was named after Piercesare Tombolato, a goalkeeper of Cittadella who died in hospital after a collision with a rival player in a match against [[Calcio Padova]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stadiumdb.com/stadiums/ita/stadio_piercesare_tombolato |title=Stadio Piercesare Tombolato |website=Stadiumdb.com |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://footballtripper.com/italy/cittadella-stadium/#:~:text=The%20stadium%20is%20named%20after,Padua%20on%203rd%20March%201957. |title=Stadio Piercesare Tombolato |website=Football Tripper |date= }}</ref>

The stadium's capacity was boosted to 7,500 for the 2008â€“09 season, in order to enable [[A.S. Cittadella]] play in their home town, though it needed a dispensation from the [[FIGC]], that requires a stadium of at least 10,000 seats for Serie B. The first game in the renovated stadium was against [[A.C. Ancona]] on October 29, 2008.
