After the failure of the [[Spanish Armada]], the English Government took severe measures against some of the Catholic priests in its custody. Crockett and James with two others, John Oven and Francis Edwardes, were selected for trial, which took place at [[Chichester]] on 30 September 1588. All were condemned to death, under 27 Eliz. c. 2, for being priests and coming into the realm; but Oven on taking the [[Oath of Supremacy]] was respited. The other three were drawn on one hurdle to Broyle Heath, near Chichester, where Edwardes recanted. Crockett ascended the scaffold and blessed the crowd in Latin which brought shouts of anger upon him, however he changed into praying in English whereupon the crowd cheered. James and Crockett faced their deaths without fear and were executed after absolving each other.

Blessed Ralph Crockett's father Adam, in his later years entered the Church on the Continent and his descendants remained [[recusant]] continued to practise their Catholic Faith in the face of continued persecution. In 1929 Ralph Crockett was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Pius XI]]. His feast day is 1 October.
