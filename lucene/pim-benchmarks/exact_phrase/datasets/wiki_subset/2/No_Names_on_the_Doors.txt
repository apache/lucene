''No Names on the Doors'' is the third film in director Levitan's trilogy about Israeli [[kibbutz]]im, following ''[[An Intimate Story]]'' (1981) and ''[[Stalin's Disciples]]'' (1986).

==Plot==
The film is set on a modern [[kibbutz]] as the spectre of an Arab invasion lurks in the background and financial pressures are breaking down traditional communal values. A series of fragile, interwoven stories mirror this disintegration of collective ideals: a longstanding friendship between two 40-year-old bachelors ([[Danni Bassan]] and Meir Swissa) ends tragically when one decides to get married; a bereaved father is embarrassed to find himself attracted to his dead son's girlfriend (Dorit Lev-Ari); and a mother ([[Hava Alberstein|Chava Alberstein]]) perpetuates the memory of her dead son by tending to his room as a memorial. At the same time, an elderly man ([[Mosko Alkalai]]) discovers a new, more loving relationship with his intellectually-disabled adult son (Avi Pnini).

==Reception==
Deborah Young of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that Levitan's third film in his kibbutz trilogy "brings the action to the present day to show the sad dissolution of collective ideals that were these agricultural co-ops' ''raison d'etre''. Though not exceptionally original, the fragile, interwoven stories have a sincere, heartfelt quality that should play well in specialized film weeks and venues."<ref>Deborah Young (26 April 1997), [https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117341316?refcatid=31 ''"No Names on the Doors"''], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (accessed 1 December 2012).</ref>  Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the movie "tender" and "moving".<ref>Kevin Thomas (6 November 1997), [https://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/06/entertainment/ca-50579 "Israeli Festival Begins"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (accessed 5 December 2012).</ref>
