:*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] New enough, long enough (only just), suitably referenced, no copyright violations detected looking at a sample of the references. Hook is referenced. QPQ is missing, though, based on the assumption that you have at least five previous DYKs. If that is not the case, please advise.

::*QPQ not needed as Legoktm has 3 DYKs. [[User:Thine Antique Pen|Thine Antique Pen]] ([[User talk:Thine Antique Pen|talk]]) 17:27, 20 November 2012 (UTC)
