No indication of notability. As a Romanian I find this offensive, why isn't he doing this for Hungary? He is Hungarian from the Szekely Land, Romania. He doesn't even consider himself Romanian. As you know the Hungarians request Transylvania back from Romania. No any other countries has something like this. Romania isn't the country of gypsies as you want to suggest. Romania doesn't have more gypsies than Hungary or some other countries from East Europe. Moreover, there is a problem when people are searching for the List of cities and towns in Romania, it also appears this. It is made intentionally to discredit my country. Why are the Hungarians from Romania or from Hungary working so hard against Romania on Wikipedia? Why Hungary didn't publish the percent of the Roma population after the 2011 census? Instead, they are doing this for our towns pretending they are Romanians. Of course, they have Romanian IP but in fact they are from the Szekely Land, Hungarians.

*'''Delete''' - not really sure of the validity of this article. That said, I don't like the tone of the AfD, in fact I don't understand it either - seems to be implying racism is occurring whilst actually being quasi-racist in itself. Furthermore, it looks like the nominator has completely fluffed up the tagging in the main article, adding an invalid old AfD tag.

::And now I've removed that invalid tag. [[User:Saywhaaaaaat|Saywhaaaaaat]], please do not use the old AfD tag in an article when it immediately refers to your current AfD, and when there is no previous AfD. [[User:Lukeno94|Lukeno94]] ([[User talk:Lukeno94|talk]]) 22:03, 9 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Procedural close'''.  I'm not really certain whether this material belongs in Wikipedia in this form, as part of our role as a gazetteer, or whether it's the sort of primary-source population data that lacks independent notability (and should redirect to [[Roma in Romania]], perhaps?).  But I ''am'' certain that this deletion nomination's text is an attack against the Roma as a group, but also against the originators of this data (and possible the editor who created the article; to be honest, it's a little hard to discern the target of the vitriol), and that's just not an acceptable start to a deletion discussion. [[User:Squeamish Ossifrage|Squeamish Ossifrage]] ([[User talk:Squeamish Ossifrage|talk]]) 22:46, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

::*'''Comment''' - Squeamish Ossifrage, this material doesn't belong in Wiki in this form. Please include it to [[Roma in Romania]], if not please consider the deletion. No other country has such link for a population of only 3.3%. Sorry for calling the Roma population as gypsy, but it was called like this until 1992 or something and I didn't want people to make the confusion between the Romanians and the Romas/Romanis. The Roma population is a minority in Romania. This page is only confusing the wikipedians: when I'm searching for the [[List of cities and towns in Romania]] I'm getting this. It is not normal, if I want something about the Roma population, a minority of 3.3% people in Romania, I go to [[Roma in Romania]]. [[User:Saywhaaaaaat|Saywhaaaaaat]] ([[User talk:Saywhaaaaaat|talk]]) 03:08, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

:::*'''Comment''' - I can assure you I have nothing against the Roma, to understand me better some of the Romanian citizens of Hungarian ethnicity like this user, keep suggesting in any way that Romania is the country of gypsies, while this Roma population is in minority in this country (3.3%). If I would have had something against the Roma, I would have written something at [[Roma in Romania]]. This page is not useful and only creates conflicts between Romanians and Hungarians. [[User:Saywhaaaaaat|Saywhaaaaaat]] ([[User talk:Saywhaaaaaat|talk]]) 03:15, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

*<s>'''Delete'''</s> - Therefore, please consider deletion or to include in the [[Roma in Romania]] article. And for the Hungarians: if you keep attacking my country Romania, I will do exactly the same on Wikipedia for Hungary. I give you my word. Day and night like you do! And without being paid like you are. [[User:Saywhaaaaaat|Saywhaaaaaat]] ([[User talk:Saywhaaaaaat|talk]]) 03:15, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' -- being offended by an article is not valid grounds for deletion. There are many other articles from other countries with similar demographics data: [[Lists of UK locations with large ethnic minority populations]], [[List of U.S. cities with large African American populations]] and a few dozen more in [[Lists of U.S. cities with large ethnic identity populations]]. [[User:Bogdangiusca|bogdan]] ([[User talk:Bogdangiusca|talk]]) 09:42, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

:*'''Comment''' - Can you read? Then move the [[List of towns in Romania by Romani population]] page to [[Lists of Romanian cities with large ethnic identity populations]]. And we also include the other minorities such as Hungarians, Germans, Ukrainians, Turks, Serbs, Russians, etc. Do you understand my point of view or not? This material doesn't belong in Wiki in this form. It only creates a confusion when I type searching for the [[List of cities and towns in Romania]] article. What if we create individual page like this for all the minorities? Then I don't find the List of cities and towns in Romania. This article should go to [[Roma in Romania]] or [[Lists of Romanian cities with large ethnic identity populations]] where to include all these minorities.

::*'''Rename''', if the name is your problem, to [[List of Romanian cities with large Romani populations]].  (Note that [[Lists of U.S. cities with large ethnic identity populations]] is a meta-list, whose Romanian analogue, if it existed, would ''include a link'' to the article that you deplore.)  If there is no [[List of Romanian cities with large Hungarian populations]], well, something had to be the first one. —[[User:Tamfang|Tamfang]] ([[User talk:Tamfang|talk]]) 16:46, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

:'''Merge''' with [[Roma minority in Romania]] main article. The [[History of the Jews in Hungary]] article lists Jewish population by town to show populations wiped out during the [[Holocaust]], I think this list would be similarly appropriate for the main article on the Roma minority in Romania rather than as a standalone list. Agree that original AfD comments are disparaging of Roma in tone, and not coherent justification for an AfD, but anyway, I would like to suggest a merge for this list.

*'''Keep''': I am just not seeing a basis for deletion in the nomination of this six-year old article.  The rest of the world barely understands the squabbles among Eastern European countries over these things, everything offends somebody, its like an American high school.--'''[[User:Milowent|Milowent]]''' • <small><sup style="position:relative">[[Special:Contributions/Milowent|has]]<span style="position:relative;bottom:-2.0ex;left:-3.2ex;*left:-5.5ex;">[[User talk:Milowent|spoken]]</span></sup></small> 14:09, 15 November 2012 (UTC)
