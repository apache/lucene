==Reviews==
"The challenge of making this film was almost as severe as the challenge of the journey it depicts. The makers showed great imagination to get around the limitations of a zero budget, livening up the narrative with interviews, jokes, sight gags, even dance! It gently raised important issues along the way, allowing these issues to arise quite naturally out of the journey itself." -VIMFF Jury Statement for Grand Prize winner 'Borealis'

"An appealing ground-level spin on environmental issues" - The Vancouver Province
