'''Rockcliffe railway station''', later '''Rockcliffe Halt''' was a station which served the rural area around [[Rockcliffe, Cumbria|Rockcliffe]], Rockcliffe Parish, north of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in the [[English county]] of [[Cumbria]]. It was served by local trains on what is now known as the [[West Coast Main Line]]. The nearest station for Rockcliffe is now at [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]].

== History ==
Opened by the [[Caledonian Railway]],<ref name="Butt21"/> it became part of the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] during the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of 1923 and BR in 1948. It closed briefly during WW1 and was renamed as Rockcliffe Halt in 1950 when regular passenger service ceased after which it was only used by railway workers at the nearby marshalling yards  until 1965.<ref>[http://www.cumbrianrailways.org.uk/Scottish.php Cumbrian Railways Association] Retrieved : 2012-11-09</ref>

The station had a stationmaster's house, with combined ticket office and a waiting room. The line is still double track here.
