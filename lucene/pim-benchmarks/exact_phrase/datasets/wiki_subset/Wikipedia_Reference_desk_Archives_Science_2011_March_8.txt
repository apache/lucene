== Blood [[erythritol]] ==

The [[polyol]] erythritol is used as a sugar substitute.  Although it is absorbed by the body and passed through the kidneys, it is not metabolized.  It does not increase "[[blood sugar]]", i.e. blood glucose, it ''is'' a sugar alcohol.  Even so, it actually has ''anti''-oxidant effect.<sup>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19632091]</sup>  Even so, I have to ask: is erythritol also a kind of "blood sugar" -- i.e., does erythritol have any properties that duplicate those of an equal amount of glucose?  For example, does it increase [[blood viscosity]], cross-link proteins, or add to strain on the kidneys? [[User:Wnt|Wnt]] ([[User talk:Wnt|talk]]) 01:37, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

== Gear trains  ==

actually i have solved a gear train questions which is giving negetive value for number of tooth for one of the gears.what could i interpret from that.
should i take absolute value of the number of tooth.

::::Don't forget that the normal situation with planet gears is that the annular gear is fixed and the sun gear drives the planets.  This question requires the sun to be fixed and the planets driving the annular ring.  This is a completely different case.  My reasoning is as follows: In one revolution of the spider, if the planets were not free to move independently, the annulus would be carried round one revolution also.  However, since the planets ''are'' free to move, the annulus will be driven forward from this position (of exactly one revolution) by the turning of the planets.  How far forward? - that would be the number of teeth on one planet times the number of times it rolls as it turns one revolution of the sun.  If the sun (''S'') is ''n'' times the teeth of planet (''P'') then the forward position is ''nP'' or, with a little thought, equal to ''S''.  So the total roatation of the annulus for one rotation of the spider is 1+''S''/''A''.  Since it is a physical requirement that ''S''<''A'' then 1<Rot<sub>A</sub>/Rot<sub>spider</sub><2.  A doubling of speed is the limiting case of infinitely large sun gear and annulus.  I got a different numerical answer to the OP, but like the OP it was fractional and negative.

== Flight angle ==

An accident occured in which the vehicle was twisted at flight angle. What does the term "flight angle" mean technically and also how is it used on day to day basis?
aniketnik 16:26, 8 March 2011 (UTC)  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Aniketnik|Aniketnik]] ([[User talk:Aniketnik|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aniketnik|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::Probably, "flight angle" refers to either the [[angle of attack]] (the angle of elevation of the ''wing surface,'' relative to horizon, as a rotation along the pitch-axis); or to the [[Flight dynamics|pitch angle]] (the angle of the aircraft ''airframe,'' measured relative to the horizon, along the axis designated as the "pitch axis").  In the case of a catastrophic accident, those two angles might not be identical!  See our diagram for the conventional layout; and on ''most'' fixed-wing aircraft, note that pitch and angle-of-attack of the wing surface are fixed relative to each other.  Other important "angles" are described in our [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|aircraft flight dynamics article]], with animations.  Your exact quote, "twisted at flight angle", sounds very ambiguous - it is ''possible'' that the intended meaning is that the aircraft was within its normal operating orientation limits and should ''not'' have [[Stall (flight)|stalled]].  If you provide a source for your exact quote, we may be able to interpret the intended meaning a little better.  [[User:Nimur|Nimur]] ([[User talk:Nimur|talk]]) 17:00, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

== spin ==

How can they force the spin axes into a horizontal alignment by imposing an electric field that alternates at radio frequencies like it says in this article http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n11_v133/ai_6507705/  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Lufc88|Lufc88]] ([[User talk:Lufc88|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lufc88|contribs]]) 17:55, 8 March 2011 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:It would help us to better answer this question if you were to explain what exactly you are having difficulty with in that article.  You might find what you are looking for in [[magnetic moment]] and [[Electron magnetic dipole moment]].  Simply put, a spinning electron is equivalent to a circulating loop of electric current and consequently has a magnetic field identical to a small dipole magnet.  For this reason, the electron will be acted on by external magnetic fields and, in particular, will tend to align the axis of spin with the field.  At least, this is the situation with classical field theory, to get the full picture quantum mechanics must be applied.  When this is done it is found that the dipole moment can take on only certain quantised values.

== Standardization in Redox Titrations ==

Hello. Is standardization of KIO<sub>3</sub> necessary before titrating against ascorbic acid if I am preparing KIO<sub>3(aq)</sub> from its solid? Thanks in advance. --[[User:Mayfare|Mayfare]] ([[User talk:Mayfare|talk]]) 21:42, 8 March 2011 (UTC)
:Hi [[User:Mayfare|Mayfare]]. I think you have to ask yourself what reasons might mean that weighing solid [[Potassium iodate|KIO<sub>3</sub>]] might not accurately tell you the molarity of the solution. Here are a few to consider...

:*Purity of solute (KIO<sub>3</sub>) as sold. Was the solute intended for use as a primary standard or is it just a ground-up radiation pill, etc?
:*Storage. Has the solute been kept in an airtight container so that it can't react with atmospheric gases around the lab? Would that be an issue?
:*Humidity. Is the solute totally dry? If not, how might you dry it before use?
:*Purity of solvent (H<sub>2</sub>O). You might get an extra mark for mentioning this!
:*Accuracy of weighing. How much solute are you weighing out? What is the precision of the weighing device?
:*Accuracy of dilution. What errors might you expect here?

== Inheritance traits and DNA ==

Is it possible to determine the skin tone, hair/eye color and blood group after studying the inheritance traits during [[DNA analysis]]? --[[Special:Contributions/89.76.224.253|89.76.224.253]] ([[User talk:89.76.224.253|talk]]) 22:33, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:It certainly is in the DNA somewhere (barring the use of hair dye, colored contacts, and such), but I'm not sure if we know exactly where.  It's sometimes vastly more complex than just one chunk of DNA which sets each trait.  There might also be certain diseases or environmental factors which might have an effect (like sun-bleached hair). [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 23:06, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:(ec)There are some claiming to do this.[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1146503/DNA-left-crime-scene-used-create-picture-criminals-FACE-say-scientists.html][http://forensicdnaethics.org/news-a-announcements/forensic-dna-ethics-news/120-eye-color-genes-may-help-forensic-investigations]  This is fairly embryonic, and I would keep an eye out for chicanery.  Genetic testing to determine the blood type shouldn't be difficult, but I can't think of many situations in which it would actually be useful.

::The Daily Mail article is (no surprise) extremely misleading. It says that theoretically in the future you could reconstruct certain details about a person's face from DNA. (Granted in theory you could do this to some degree — but we're a long way away in practice, and it's unclear if those details you could extrapolate would actually be useful in identification.) Then it says something like this was already done... because they used DNA to determine that a suspect was Black rather than white. That's not the same thing at all; it's relatively easy to guess what ethnicity/racial category someone would fall in based on their DNA (it's probabilistic, but you can say things like, "you carry genes are extremely prevalent in people from this part of the world as opposed to this part of the world" — which, in some situations, is probably enough to say, "this guy is probably pretty white looking or Asian looking or Black looking" — which is not terribly precise, but could be useful in identifying a suspect). It's totally different — one is modeling development (which is hard), the other is tracing origins (which is not as hard). --[[User:Mr.98|Mr.98]] ([[User talk:Mr.98|talk]]) 23:21, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:::It's not easy to say exactly where this line is crossed, because any statistical fact is meaningful.  We shouldn't expect that one day the genetic information is worthless and the next you can draw the suspect's face - rather, there is a period when it can rule out some possible suspects and provide "most likely" values for some features. [[User:Wnt|Wnt]] ([[User talk:Wnt|talk]]) 23:38, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

::::Note that even ruling out suspects (or matching DNA) is (under currently used practices) still probabilistic. They do not currently sequence entire DNA sequences (though someday they may do this, once it gets ''really'' cheap), just a finite series of markers within them. The odds of two different sets of DNA being seen as identical under these procedures is small but not impossible. (And calculating those odds depends on what assumptions you make about the target populations.) It is to my understanding still quite rare to use DNA testing to say something about what your suspect should look like — usually DNA analysis is useful after you already have samples to compare against. --[[User:Mr.98|Mr.98]] ([[User talk:Mr.98|talk]]) 00:36, 9 March 2011 (UTC)

== Speed of back-and-forth motion ==

How to measure the speed of continous back-and-forth motion? One b&f move per second? -)  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/89.76.224.253|89.76.224.253]] ([[User talk:89.76.224.253|talk]]) 22:56, 8 March 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:How about dividing the total distance traveled per cycle by the time for each cycle ?  This will give you the average speed.  However, if you want the instantaneous speed, which would be expected to be zero at the furthest extensions and (normally) at maximum in the center, that gets trickier. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 23:03, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

::If I continously make for example 0,5 m back and forth per 1 s, that would be 0,5 m/sec per cycle, I guess? But what about instances where speed is inequal? --[[Special:Contributions/89.76.224.253|89.76.224.253]] ([[User talk:89.76.224.253|talk]]) 23:08, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

::::If it goes half a meter one way, then half a meter back, that's 1 meter total.  If that happens in one second, then that's an average of 1 meter per second.  However, the speed WILL be uneven.  That is, it must stop and turn around at the end of it's motion at each end.  This is what I was getting to with "instantaneous velocity", which is the speed at any given time.  If we make some additional assumptions, like constant acceleration/deceleration and no rest time at each end, we might even be able to come up with a graph of the instantaneous velocity at each point in the cycle, from the data you supplied. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 23:19, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:::Do you mean [[Hertz]]?  You could say that the motion has frequency v and then calculate the position = K sin (2 pi vt) and therefore velocity = 2 pi K v cos (2 pi vt) [the derivative].  (K is half the total distance moved; the 2 pi factor converts [[cycles per second]] to [[radians per second]], which can be multiplied by seconds and input into the sin function)  But only if it moves sinusoidally.  It could just bounce back and forth at constant velocity, for example.
:::To elaborate, suppose you have a piston that is driven by something that circles 0.25 m away from a central pivot once per second.  Therefore the piston moves 0.5 m back ''and'' forth once per second.  (Depending on the linkage I don't think this is precisely sinusoidal, but it could be)  Time zero is the piston half extended, moving outward.  The position of the piston is simply 0.25 m (2 pi t).  When t = 0.25 it is 0.25, 0.5 it is 0, 0.75 it is -0.25, 1 it is 0.25 again.  The velocity of the piston is (2 pi radians/cycle) (0.25 m) (1 cycle/second) cos (2 pi radians/cycle * 1 cycle/second * t).  At t=0 this is 0.5 pi "radians" m/s = about 1.57 m/s.  The decision to use radians in the velocity is momentarily confusing (both radians and cycles are in a sense "dimensionless") but radians signify the actual distance traveled, whereas cycles are merely a count of events.  [[User:Wnt|Wnt]] ([[User talk:Wnt|talk]]) 23:24, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

::::Only a massless object could do that.  Any real world object takes some time to accelerate and decelerate.  However, the instantaneous velocity profile isn't necessarily sinusoidal, that's only true under constant acceleration.  In the case of a ball being batted back and forth by a cat, for example, this wouldn't be the case. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 23:23, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:::::I just edited the above a little, but to address your point, yes, there is at least some period of acceleration.  But if the impact is elastic at either end, it would be a very small amount of time. [[User:Wnt|Wnt]] ([[User talk:Wnt|talk]]) 23:26, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:So, we should ask, what's driving this object to move back and forth ?  This may help us to determine what type of motion and acceleration we're dealing with. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 23:28, 8 March 2011 (UTC)
