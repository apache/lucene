==Mission==
ANFEAE works to tackle the major educational challenges that Ethiopia confronts by implementing and helping manage education projects. [[UNESCO]] outlines the basic structure of such programs in ANFEAE: 
<blockquote>Educational material is developed by a group consisting of teachers, learners and representatives from health and agriculture organizations. The training course lasts two years (300 hours of instruction in all) in classes of 25 participants, and costs a total of US$240,000, or less than US$40 per pupil. Funds come from [[USAID]] Via Pact Ethiopia, [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|SIDA]] Via Pact Ethiopia, the [[Addis Abeba]], World Bank-Small Grant Programme as well as donations from ANFEAE members. Some former learners become teachers, after a month's training. Each is responsible for 50 pupils and receives a monthly salary of US$45.<ref name="Winners 2008"/></blockquote>

ANFAE's mission is to "help economic and social development of the country through promoting Life Long Learning and facilitating quality and life-enhancing education and training for adults, the youth and children in rural and urban areas of Ethiopia."<ref>{{cite web|title=Missions and objectives |url=http://www.anfeae.org/obj/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904015212/http://www.anfeae.org/obj/ |archivedate=2011-09-04 }}</ref>  ANFEAE cites numerous outlets through which education in Ethiopia can be cultivated and enhanced: capacity building, research and documentation, women and empowerment, cross cutting issues, and networking and partnership. The goal is to promote community-based organizations, grassroots governmental institutions, literacy and learning initiatives among women, HIV/AIDS awareness, and the establishment and strengthening of partnerships and networks among educational institutions and communities.

==Recognition==
In 2008, ANFEAE won the UNESCO International Literacy Prize for its Literacy Plus project. The project was based on the initiative that "women are the future of mankind."<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO Award for Literacy |url=http://www.anfeae.org/news/more.php?id=9 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904014606/http://www.anfeae.org/news/more.php?id=9 |archivedate=4 September 2011 }}</ref>  According to EAEA, Literacy Plus is a women's empowerment program that “combines business, banking, peace building, conflict resolution, malaria control, animal management and literacy, a program in which women become social activists and social entrepreneurs, effective leaders who are bringing about change in their community.” Through this project, ANFEAE helped empower over 6,200 rural poor women by helping them acquire relevant literacy and business and management-related skills.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethiopia has won the UNESCO International Literacy Prize of 2008 |url=http://www.eaea.org/news.php?aid=15765 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012458/http://www.eaea.org/news.php?aid=15765 |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref>  According to ANFEAE director Alemayehu Haily Gebre, a survey of 3,000 women, out of the total 6,200, showed that half of them (over 1,500) increased their revenues by 25%.<ref name="Winners 2008"/>
