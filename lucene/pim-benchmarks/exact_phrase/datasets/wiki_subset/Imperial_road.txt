In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times, '''imperial roads''' ({{lang-de|Reichsstraße}}) were designated routes in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] that afforded protection to travellers in return for tolls collected for the emperor.

The ''Reichsstraße'' came under royal jurisdiction (''[[Königsbann]]'') and travellers were afforded the protection of the ''[[Landfrieden]]'', a law that was supposed to ensure peace and unhindered passage similar to the [[Queen's peace]]. From the 10th century it was also extended to bridges and ferries. Under King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I of Germany]] the term ''Reichsstrasse'' (''des [[Reich|riches]] strâze'' in [[Middle High German]]) was used for the first time as a translation of ''strata imperialis''. 

According to [[Charlemagne]]'s legislation, based on Gallic [[public law]], the maintenance of roads, the responsibility for transport infrastructure and security were part of the duties and privileges of the king, his "[[regalia]]". In return the king received the [[taxes]]. He invested the territorial rulers through whose lordships the roads ran, with the execution of these duties. A safe-conduct letter (''tote Geleit'') or an armed escort (''lebende Geleit''), ensured the safety of the travellers. The escort was provided on specified occasions, of which travelling to the election and coronation of Roman-German kings and emperors was the most important, whereas travelling to [[trade fair]]s and [[market (place)|market]]s were the most common. 

Important imperial roads were the north-south [[Via Imperii]] and the east-west [[Via Regia]] meeting at [[Leipzig]], as well as the [[Via Carolina]] from the [[Free imperial city|Imperial city]] of [[Nuremberg]] to [[Prague]] established by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the [[Hellweg]], the [[Burgundy Way]] and Italian Way/[[Via Francigena]].
