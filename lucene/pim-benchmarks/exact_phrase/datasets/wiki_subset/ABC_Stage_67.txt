===Unaired episode===
A behind the scenes documentary of a May 1966 British concert tour by the musician [[Bob Dylan]] was promoted by the network as a forthcoming episode. ''[[Eat the Document]]'', as the film was later titled, was never shown as part of the series. Editing delays and an un-television "art house" choice of camera technique are believed to be the reasons.
