'''Gibson Edgar Carpenter''', a gentleman farmer, lawyer, and judge, purchased the house in the early 1920s to ensure his children would receive the best education in the Plano school system. [[Carpenter Middle School]], named for Carpenterâ€™s father Robert Washington Carpenter, is located on land formerly owned by the family.
