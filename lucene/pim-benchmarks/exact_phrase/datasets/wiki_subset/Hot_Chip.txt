'''Hot Chip''' are an <!-- ("They are") Please note that British English uses the plural "are" instead of the Americanised singular "is" --> English [[synth-pop]] band formed in [[London]] in 2000. The group consists of multi-instrumentalists [[Alexis Taylor]], [[Joe Goddard (musician)|Joe Goddard]], [[Al Doyle]], Owen Clarke, and Felix Martin. They are occasionally supplemented by Rob Smoughton and [[Sarah Jones (drummer)|Sarah Jones]] for live performances and studio recordings. The group primarily produces music in the synth-pop and [[alternative dance]] genres, drawing influences from [[house music|house]] and [[disco]].

Hot Chip began as a bedroom recording project for Taylor and Goddard, who met while students at [[Elliott School, Putney]]; their earliest lineup included Smoughton as their drummer. After completing two EPs, ''Mexico'' (2001) and ''San Frandisco'' (2002), the group released their debut album, ''[[Coming on Strong (album)|Coming on Strong]]'' (2004) and added Doyle, Clarke, and Martin to their lineup. The band's second album, ''[[The Warning (Hot Chip album)|The Warning]]'' (2006), was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]]. Their follow-up, ''[[Made in the Dark]]'' (2008), included the single "[[Ready for the Floor]]", which was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]]. The band have subsequently released the albums ''[[One Life Stand]]'' (2010), ''[[In Our Heads]]'' (2012), ''[[Why Make Sense?]]'' (2015), and ''[[A Bath Full of Ecstasy]]'' (2019).

Outside of Hot Chip, the band members, individually and in partnership with each other, are active in other musical acts and occasionally perform [[DJ]] sets.

===2005–2007: ''The Warning''===
[[File:Hot chip at the parish (114897386).jpg|thumb|Hot Chip performing in 2006]]
In 2006, Hot Chip released their second album, ''[[The Warning (Hot Chip album)|The Warning]]''. Now signed to EMI in the United Kingdom, the band gained more mainstream appeal as well as the attention of critics. The album was shortlisted for the [[Mercury Prize|2006 Nationwide Mercury Prize]] and was Mixmag's Album of the Year 2006.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gibson, Owen|title=Mercury judges opt for eclectic shortlist|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/19/arts.mercuryprize2006|accessdate=23 July 2019|date=19 July 2006}}</ref> This album spawned also two [[UK Singles Chart|UK top 40]] singles: "[[Over and Over (Hot Chip song)|Over and Over]]" in March 2006 and "[[Boy from School]]" in May 2006.

===2007–2009: ''Made in the Dark''===
[[File:Hot Chip performing at 2007 Coachella 2.jpg|thumb|Hot Chip performing at the 2007 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]]]
The band released their third studio album, ''[[Made in the Dark]]'', on 4 February 2008. The first song to be released from it was "[[Shake a Fist]]", which was released as a limited one-sided 12-inch vinyl in August 2007. The second release was "[[Ready for the Floor]]" in January 2008, which peaked at number six on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/ready-for-the-floor/|title=Ready for the Floor|publisher=UK Singles Chart|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> In order to promote "Ready for the Floor", the band appeared on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' in January 2008, and Joe Goddard appeared on ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' on 31 January. In February 2008, the band performed on the American talk shows [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and [[Carson Daly]]. At the end of 2008, "Ready For The Floor" received a [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]] nomination, but the song later lost out to "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger|Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger (Alive 2007)]]" by [[Daft Punk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/dance.htm|title=Rock On The Net: Grammy Awards: Best Dance Recording|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> On 7 May 2008, the group performed their third single, "[[One Pure Thought]]", on Radio 1's [[Live Lounge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/livelounge/artist/080507_hotchip.shtml|title=Hot Chip: Live Lounge|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> The hypnotic clip for "One Pure Thought" was selected as one of the best music videos of 2008 by [[AllMusic]].

===2009–2010: ''One Life Stand''===
Having completed a world tour in February 2009, Hot Chip returned to London and began writing and recording their fourth album, ''[[One Life Stand]]''.

In early 2009, [[Alexis Taylor]] told ''NME'' that the band recorded new songs including "Alley Cats", which the band played regularly while touring in 2008/2009. Initially, Taylor hinted that the album was going to be "a bit calmer this time" in comparison to ''[[Made in the Dark]]'' with songs that are "more mid-tempo and disco influenced", although the two tracks released prior to the album, "Take It In" and "One Life Stand", suggest that it will be more upbeat than first suggested, and may be more influenced by early house music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hot Chip cover Joy Division and Vampire Weekend|work=[[NME]]|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/hot-chip-41-1326798|accessdate=23 July 2019|date=10 September 2008}}</ref> Alongside the regular band members, Hot Chip collaborated on several of the album tracks with the drummer [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]] from [[This Heat]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.factmag.com/2011/02/07/hot-chip-spiritualized-and-this-heat-members-collaborate-on-new-lp/|title=Hot Chip, Spiritualized and This Heat members collaborate on new LP|date=7 February 2011|magazine=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]}}</ref> and [[Camberwell Now]], Leo Taylor, drummer from the London-based band [[The Invisible (band)|The Invisible]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/the-invisible-to-re-issue-debut-album-with-hot-chip-matthew-herbert-remixes-117428|title=The Invisible to re-issue debut album with Hot Chip & Matthew Herbert remixes|author=Luke Morgan Britton|website=[[The Line of Best Fit]]|date=5 February 2013|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> and the Trinidadian steel pan player Fimber Bravo.

''One Life Stand'' was released on 1 February 2010.

===2011–2013: ''In Our Heads''===
[[File:Al Doyle Alexis Taylor Hot Chip Popaganda 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Al Doyle]] and [[Alexis Taylor]] at Popaganda Music Festival 2013 in [[Stockholm, Sweden]]]]
Their self-produced fifth studio album ''[[In Our Heads]]'' was released on 11 June 2012 by [[Domino Recording Company|Domino]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dominorecordco.com/uk/news/01-03-12/hot-chips-new-album-in-your-heads-very-soon/|title=Hot Chip's New Album In Your Heads Very Soon!|publisher=[[Domino Recording Company]]|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref>

About the album, Taylor stated, "I think ''In Our Heads'' was a bit speedier, and made with less pressure, but more fun – partly due to people in the band not having too many hang ups about how good the material was – we seemed to be happy with the songs we were writing and they came quickly – and partly due to the fact that we had been enjoying ourselves elsewhere, whether at home, or on tour, or recording with our other projects, or DJing. I think that is right about [having a] subtler confidence, but it may also be that we are a bit more accepted these days as we keep doing what we want, and gradually people stop saying 'why' to everything and each decision. The songwriting developed quickly from songs that were dreamt ('Now There is Nothing'); songs that were written via email file sending (fully fleshed out instrumentals from Joe developing into songs with added percussion/chord changes and singing by me; e.g. 'Flutes'); songs that we bashed out in collaborative writing sessions between Joe and myself ('Don't Deny Your Heart', 'How Do You Do?'); songs that one or the other of us wrote largely separately 'These Chains'– Joe/'Look At Where We Are'- Alexis); songs that a few of us in the room wrote more of: 'Dark and Stormy', or to some extent "Let Me Be Him" (at least in chorus terms); or finally songs that were written after we completed the last album and which were still in our minds: 'Always Been Your Love', 'Doctor'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldwt.net/2012/07/don’t-deny-your-heart-hot-chip/|title=Don't Deny Your Heart: Hot Chip|accessdate=23 July 2019|work=Love and Dishwater Tablets|date=20 July 2012|language=zh}}</ref> "Dark and Stormy" has been since released as a non-album single.
