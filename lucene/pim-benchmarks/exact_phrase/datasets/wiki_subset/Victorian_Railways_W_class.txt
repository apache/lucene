==History==
In mid 1957 the Victorian Railways called for tenders for a fleet of 25 diesel-hydraulic locomotives rated at 500&nbsp;hp. [[Tulloch Limited|Tulloch Ltd.]], based in [[Rhodes, NSW]], won the contract with an offer for West German styled locomotives, using a Mercedes V12 diesel engine to develop 660&nbsp;hp which was then coupled to a Krupp 2W1D46 hydraulic transmission powering the centre axle, with the leading and trailing axles powered via connecting rods. The full 25 engines entered service in the year from December 1959.<ref>Jehan, D. 2015, A History of Tulloch Engineers and Manufacturers Pyrmont & Rhodes 1883-1974, Eveleigh Press, pp.174-177, {{ISBN|978 1 876568 83 2}}</ref>

Tulloch expected a repeat order for a further 25 units from the Victorian Railways, and also built a standard gauge version numbered 7101 as a demonstrator unit for the New South Wales Railways. However, the latter system rejected the design as not suitable, and so that unit was sold to the Victorian Railways and used for construction trains on the Albury to Melbourne route. After that project was completed it became one of the standard gauge shunting units operating between South Dynon and Spencer Street Station. The final engine, W267, had been built in anticipation of the repeat order that never eventuated - while the contract was written, it was never signed.<ref>Jehan, D. 2015, A History of Tulloch Engineers and Manufacturers Pyrmont & Rhodes 1883-1974, Eveleigh Press, pp.174-177, {{ISBN|978 1 876568 83 2}}</ref> Instead, the final engine was converted to standard gauge and shared duties with W266.

Engines were fitted with controls on both sides of the centre console, although these were removed not long after delivery.<ref>Jehan, D. 2015, A History of Tulloch Engineers and Manufacturers Pyrmont & Rhodes 1883-1974, Eveleigh Press, pp.174-177, {{ISBN|978 1 876568 83 2}}</ref><ref>http://victorianrailways.net/motive%20power/wdie/wdie.html</ref> The engines were initially rostered on local passenger services to Werribee and trialled on Bacchus Marsh runs, but with the low speed limit of 40&nbsp;mph and relatively little power they were unable to keep the latter timetables.

The engines proved incredibly unpopular due to ride quality problems, engine reliability issues and a transmission change needed to achieve mainline running speeds. The high gear setting was removed early on and the class relegated to shunting duties in an attempt to better utilise the fleet. However, the cab profile made visibility a problem in yards, and engine crews had to lean out the side to observe shunting instructions. The cab design also provided no shelter from the weather in storms or on hot days. Common failures included seized transmissions, oil leaking onto the shunters steps presenting a slip hazard, and failed engine blocks.<ref>Motive Power, May/June 2018 (No.117), pp.36-38</ref>

Between 1973 and 1977 at least ten engines, starting with W249,<ref>Motive Power, May/June 2018 (No.117), pp.36-38</ref> had these removed and replaced with General Motors diesel units. Engines after the first had different exhaust arrangements, but all those refitted could be identified externally by a second exhaust stack at the end of the long hood, with the original adjacent to the driving cabin plated over.<ref>http://victorianrailways.net/motive%20power/wdie/wdie.html</ref> The alterations raised the engine hood by 208mm but did not replace the original transmission or gearbox.<ref>Victorian Railways staff newsletter, May 1973</ref>

The class was generally allocated to Ballarat, Geelong and Melbourne for short shunting trips, and one each at Ararat, Bendigo and Seymour explicitly for yard work only. However on the odd occasion W241 (Seymour Based) was use on the Shepperton Goods and also out to Rushworth & Colbinabbin. It also made it to Benalla a few times. <ref>Information from former Depot Foreman Seymour.</ref>

The '''71 class''' was a class of diesel locomotive operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] in Australia.

===Powertrain===
The locomotive was of the 0-6-0 wheel arrangement, fitted with a 12-cylinder [[Mercedes-Benz]] engine, [[Krupp]] [[Torque converter|hydraulic transmission]] and axle-gear and [[Behr]] hydraulic cooling equipment.

===History===
Having just completed 25 {{RailGauge|1600mm|allk=on}} {{convert|650|hp|kW|abbr=on}}<!-- Does not agree with infobox --> [[diesel-hydraulic]] shunting [[Victorian Railways W class (diesel-hydraulic)|W class]] locomotives for the [[Victorian Railways]], [[Tulloch Limited]], with a view to receiving an order for similar units, offered the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] a similar {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}} version in 1960 for a 12-month testing period. The offer was accepted and the unit was taken into service on 11 November 1960 numbered 7101. Although allocated to [[Delec Locomotive Depot]], all servicing was done at Tulloch Limited. No. 7101 was used on local transfer and shunting trips in the Sydney metropolitan area. It operated under conditions similar to the [[New South Wales 70 class locomotive|70-class]] then in operation.

In mid-1961, Tulloch Limited was experiencing operating difficulties and was unable to fulfil their obligations in regard to the hiring. 7101 was returned on 21 June 1961 and sold to Victorian Railways, who used the locomotive from 4 July on the construction of the [[North East standard gauge line, Victoria|North East standard gauge line]] between [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] and [[Melbourne]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Turton|first=Keith W|title=Six and a Half Inches From Destiny|publisher = Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division)|year=1973|isbn =0-858490-12-9|page=102}}</ref> It was repainted in the same colours as the 25 broad gauge units and renumbered W266.<ref>''The Railway News'' June 1968 page 11</ref>
