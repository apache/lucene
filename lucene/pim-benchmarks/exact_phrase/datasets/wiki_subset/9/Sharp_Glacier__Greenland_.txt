'''Sharp Glacier''' ({{lang-da|Sharp Gletscher}}), is a [[glacier]] in northwestern [[Greenland]].<ref name="mapc">{{cite web|url=https://mapcarta.com/20007942|title=Sharp Gletscher|work=Mapcarta|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> Administratively it belongs to the [[Avannaata]] municipality.

This glacier was named by [[Robert Peary]] after [[Benjamin Sharp]] (1858 â€“ 1915), zoologist of the  [[Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences]] who took part in the [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891-1892]].<ref>Robert Neff Keely, Gwilym George Davis, ''In Arctic Seas: the Voyage of the Kite with the Peary Expedition,'' 2011 p. 373</ref>

==Geography== 
The Sharp Glacier discharges from the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]] and has its [[Glacier terminus|terminus]] in the northern side of the head of the [[Inglefield Fjord]], NNW of [[Josephine Peary Island]]. Its last stretch lies between two [[nunatak]]s: [[Mount Endicott]] in the western side, separating it from the [[Hart Glacier (Greenland)|Hart Glacier]] to the west. and [[Mount Asserson]] in the eastern side, separating it from the [[Melville Glacier (Greenland)|Melville Glacier]] to the east.<ref name="mapc"/> 

The Sharp Glacier flows roughly from north to south. In the same manner as its neighboring glaciers, it has retreated by approximately {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} in the period between the 1980s and 2014.<ref name="hy">[http://hydrologie.org/redbooks/a058/05813.pdf The recent regimen of the ice cap margin in North Greenland]</ref>
