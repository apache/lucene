There is a user [[User:DrbrandY]], his account was created in 2017. Now his only edits came yesterday and all were about a page [[Yogesh Dube]]. The suspicious bit is that the user seems to be well aware of basic wiki terminologies like mainspace,sanboxes etc and about why to use a sandbox. For someone to create a C- class article on their first day of editing is odd. The more concerning bit is that this Yogesh page was deleted twice before for promotion. I also see that his userpage is strikingly similar to ones I previously reported as socks(who were confirmed).
: I suspect this to be more than just a case of paid editing. Its seems more likely to be a part of a sockfarm where this account was "aged" until autoconfirmation , But I'm not sure "who" the sockmaster could be. So how should I proceed with reporting this user?. [[User:Daiyusha|Daiyusha]] ([[User talk:Daiyusha|talk]]) 06:13, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

Other involved editors are willing to participate{{pb}} The reported behavioral-issues, which were set aside for the moment, may need to examined more carefully if another complaint becomes necessary.

{{userlinks|Bhaskarbhagawati}}

There has been an ongoing issue at [[Kamrupi dialect]], [[Kamarupi Prakrit]], as well as a number of related articles, wherein Bhaskarbhagawati wishes the articles to reflect the unqualified claim that the former (a modern dialect of Assamese) is in actuality the same language as the latter (a 12th century language). Opposition to this has been near-universal (the only other editor to agree with him has been permanently banned), particularly given the absolute lack of corroboration and, in fact, direct contradiction of this claim in literature; insomuch as Bhaskarbhagawati has provided attribution, they've been cherry-picked statements twisted from context. 

This issue has been going on sporadically for the better part of a decade and Bhaskarbhagawati [[WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT|is not listening]]. More recently, this has gotten disruptive enough to trigger a page protection [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kamrupi_dialect&diff=889307940&oldid=889304374]. He has also recently taken to stonewalling in the article talk (for example [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKamrupi_dialect&type=revision&diff=889848724&oldid=889737738]). He has brought up the dispute at [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard#Removal of reliable sources|RSN]], even though the dispute with his desired article changes has not been the sources he uses, but rather what he claims they say. This might even constitute a form of [[WP:SHOPPING]].

And, in the interest of providing some corroboration of this account, here is a list of relevant notices wherein administrators dropped the ball in sanctioning or correcting Bhaskarbhagawati's behavior
:[[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive787#Repeated removal of cited lede|ANI, February 2013]] wherein Bhaskarbhagawati and Chaipau were both warned for edit warring and the issue of Bhaskarbhagawati's stonewalling was brought up. 
:[[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive788#Repeated removal of cited lede 2|ANI, March 2013]] wherein Bhaskarbhagawati was shown to be editing disruptively and failing to contribute to productive talk page discussion.
:[[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive789#User:Bhaskarbhagawati|ANI, March 2013]] wherein Bhaskarbhagawati was again shown to be editing disruptively and not contributing productive to talk page discussion.
:[[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive764#Kamrupi dialect and abuse of quote boxes|ANI, August 2012]], [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive793#User:Kamarupi Prakrit and user User:Bhaskarbhagawati|ANI, April 2013]], and [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive803#User:Bhaskarbhagawati|ANI, June 2013]] wherein Chaipau repeatedly attempted to report Bhaskarbhagawati's disruption and edit warring, but was was told to discuss the matter some more or take the issue to DRN.

Bhaskarbhagawati does not listen to consensus. He does not cease editing when he knows his edits are contentious. His behavior has long been disruptive, and it's surely been frustrating for [[user:Chaipau]], who has spent the most time dealing with Bhaskarbhagawati's disruption. IMHO, an indefinite topic ban (which, given what he tends to edit around, would amount to a ''de facto'' ban) would be the best course of action. — [[User:Aeusoes1|Æµ§œš¹]] <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[[User talk:aeusoes1|<small><sub>[lɛts b̥iː pʰəˈlaɪˀt]</sub></small>]]</span> 04:44, 2 April 2019 (UTC)

*I won't be able to take a look at the editor conduct issues in any detail at the moment, but given the resumed edit-warring I have full-protected [[Kamarupi Prakrit]] and [[Kamrupi dialect]], and informed {{u|Bhaskarbhagawati}} about the discretionary sanctions applicable to India-related articles. [[User:Abecedare|Abecedare]] ([[User talk:Abecedare|talk]]) 04:59, 2 April 2019 (UTC)

::[[User:Abecedare|Abecedare]], i like to thank [[User:Aeusoes1|Æµ§œš¹]] for bringing the issue here, although i myself considered [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=889378817&diffmode=source bringing it here], if [[wp:edit warring]] persisted. Abecedare i like to inform here that this dispute started back in 2012, with an preconceived notion of some editors including user Chaipau and user Aesoes, that a modern language/dialect cannot have a history, thus [[Kamrupi|original article]] was divided into [[Kamrupi Prakrit]] and [[Kamrupi dialect]] citing lack of sources ?? As Aeusoes thankfully brought lot of things here, i will discuss them one by one. 

::*''There has been an ongoing issue at [[Kamrupi dialect]], [[Kamarupi Prakrit]], as well as a number of related articles, wherein Bhaskarbhagawati wishes the articles to reflect the unqualified claim that the former (a modern dialect of Assamese) is in actuality the same language as the latter (a 12th century language).''Here Aeusoes here actually supporting notions of user Chaipau that modern language/dialect cannot have a history, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kamarupi_Prakrit&diff=prev&oldid=889429775&diffmode=source he confirmed his permanent stand by saying, he is not going to consider any further sources] (although he seems layman to the subject and never contributed on it). 

::*''Opposition to this has been near-universal (the only other editor to agree with him has been permanently banned)'' Most people involved in past and present in current dispute hardly contributed to the article, other editor who he referred to was actually seems to be native speaker of Kamrupi, who seems to frustrated with their handling of the dispute. Instead of recommending mentor-ship by community, Aeusoes wrote a well designed case to topic ban him, fully supported by user Chaipau, which further aggrieved the issue. 

::*''particularly given the absolute lack of corroboration and, in fact, direct contradiction of this claim in literature; insomuch as Bhaskarbhagawati has provided attribution, they've been cherry-picked statements twisted from context.'' The said attribution was done not unilaterally as portrayed here, rather was based on recommendation of [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard#Removal of reliable sources|wp:rsn]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=890518124&diffmode=source diff], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=889681029&diffmode=source diff]), to do their part in addressing long pending dispute, which Aeusoes failed to point although he was part of discussion. For cherry picking, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kamarupi_Prakrit&oldid=890571644#References said citations] were take to wp:rsn, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=889680864&diffmode=source and they think it in different way], even [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kamarupi_Prakrit&diff=prev&oldid=889388240&diffmode=source even user Chaipau has different opinion on this]. 

::*''This issue has been going on sporadically for the better part of a decade and Bhaskarbhagawati [[WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT|is not listening]]. More recently, this has gotten disruptive enough to trigger a page protection [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kamrupi_dialect&diff=889307940&oldid=889304374].'' I agree with Aesoes on this point, this article is in bad shape since 2012, when Chaipau and other uninvolved editors including Aeusoes divided the [[Kamrupi|original article]] due to lack of sources, as informed above. As for listening, it seems Aeusoes said that he not going to consider sources further, as pointed above. As for page protection, again it is misrepresented, it was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&diff=prev&oldid=889305392&diffmode=source i who requested page protection] to halt the edit war. 

::*''He has also recently taken to stonewalling in the article talk (for example [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKamrupi_dialect&type=revision&diff=889848724&oldid=889737738]).

This might even constitute a form of [[WP:SHOPPING]].''For so called stonewalling, was a discussion where it was asked if consensus, if any, can change with newer sources, which Aeusoes answered in negative, as discussed above. As talk page discussion failed, i have taken this matter for binding consensus to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard#Removal of reliable sources]], where all the sources listed, especially most important one, along with entire reference section of both the article.

::*''And, in the interest of providing some corroboration of this account, here is a list of relevant notices wherein administrators dropped the ball in sanctioning or correcting Bhaskarbhagawati's behavior''
::''[[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive787#Repeated removal of cited lede|ANI, February 2013]] wherein Bhaskarbhagawati and Chaipau were both warned for edit warring and the issue of Bhaskarbhagawati's stonewalling was brought up.''

The selective old threads brought here by Aeusoes are linked, some of them are opened by myself, casual editor can judge it, i don't want to comment on the same.

::*''Bhaskarbhagawati does not listen to consensus. He does not cease editing when he knows his edits are contentious. His behavior has long been disruptive, and it's surely been frustrating for [[user:Chaipau]], who has spent the most time dealing with Bhaskarbhagawati's disruption. IMHO, an indefinite topic ban (which, given what he tends to edit around, would amount to a ''de facto'' ban) would be the best course of action.'' Here, what Aeusoes saying is identical as he did for other involved editor back in 2012, with selective and well designed case, overlooking that i am the original and most involved editor in [[Kamrup]] and [[Kamrupi]] topic, which otherwise attracts negligible edits. 

::Thus, to conclude it is clear case of [[wp:Assume_bad_faith|wp:bad faith editing]],[[wp:censorship]], blocking of [[wp:dispute resolution]] processes etc. Although Wikipedia is an collaborative process, involvement of user Aeusoes on the subject seems to hampering in efforts of attaining binding consensus, which can confirmed by history section of both the articles, where existing reliable sources and large old content are persistently deleted. As reliable sources and wp:noticeboards are disregarded by them, i don't know where to go next. Finally, i like to see wider involvement of editors in neglected subjects like current one, but for now its seems difficult.

** {{yo|Bhaskarbhagawati}} do you agree to take the content dispute to [[WP:DRN]] ''and'' until that is done not to edit [[Kamrupi dialect]], [[Kamarupi Prakrit]] and related articles/talkpages?
** {{yo|Aeusoes1|Chaipau}} Would you two be willing to participate in the dispute resolution if Bhaskar does initiate the process at [[WP:DRN]]?

::I'm not sure how years-long problematic contributor conduct doesn't fall under "chronic, intractable behavioral problems".   I don't have a lot of faith that DRN will yield much in the way of resolution. In the past, Bhaskarbhagawati has shied away from contributing when the DRN process starts. But I'm willing to participate. If it comes to it, we can come back here after a lack of resolution and bring the issue up again.

::: I posed the question to Bhaskar because (1) they wish to change the status quo at the articles and therefore it would be natural for them to make the case for the changes at [[WP:DRN]], and (2) as the links you provided earlier showed, Bhaskar is the one who has equivocated in the past about discussing the issue to DRN.

{{ping|Abecedare}} The issue here is not about content dispute, as [[user:Bhaskarbhagawati]] is trying to present here, but about a behavior pattern that he has persistently and consistently demonstrated since 2012.  As the remarks by others have shown, he makes no effort to come to a consensus and have persistently rejected 3O (I shall give examples later today).  Once consensus goes against his point of view, he starts [[WP:GAMINGTHESYSTEM]] to try to include his point of view, by using different templates and other techniques (e.g. using "Kamrupi language links here" on Kamrupi dialect etc.).  He floods article ledes with cherry-picked quotes that he mines with search engines.  His effort at the WP:RSN is in line with gaming the system—to get his quotes anointed as "reliable sources". Even when it was pointed out to him that it was not an RS issue, he still wanted to use it. The He tries [[WP:POVFORK]] to include his POV (e.g. [[Ancient Kamrup]] for [[Kamarupa]]).  This pattern of behavior is highly disruptive.  The stunted growth of [[Kamrupi dialect]] since 2012 is itself an example.  I shall document this pattern of behavior in more detail below sometime later. [[User:Chaipau|Chaipau]] ([[User talk:Chaipau|talk]]) 11:13, 3 April 2019 (UTC)
:Chaipau thanks and welcome to discussion. I am addressing your points below.

:*''The issue here is not about content dispute, as [[user:Bhaskarbhagawati]] is trying to present here, but about a behavior pattern that he has persistently and consistently demonstrated since 2012.'' Indeed it is in their interest to portray the same as behavior issue, although entire dispute started with division of [[Kamrupi|original article]] in 2012.

:*''As the remarks by others have shown, he makes no effort to come to a consensus and have persistently rejected 3O (I shall give examples later today).''The [[Kamrupi|original article]] is in same state since 2012, with original content long gone. Also you are constantly pointed that [[WP:3O]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=884067167&diffmode=source does not determine binding resolutions, it simply offers a non-binding third opinion on debates that exist exclusively between two editors, and would be superseded by a consensus decision] at [[wp:rsn]], [[wp:drn]] or elsewhere. 

:*''Once consensus goes against his point of view, he starts [[WP:GAMINGTHESYSTEM]] to try to include his point of view, by using different templates and other techniques (e.g. using "Kamrupi language links here" on Kamrupi dialect etc.).''The example given for so called gamingthesystem, the template <nowiki>{{Redirect|Kamrupi language||Kamrupi (disambiguation){{!}}Kamrupi}}</nowiki> cannot be a controversial one, effort here by Chaipau is to cement his point that said speech is mere dialect which entirely lacks history.

:*''He floods article ledes with cherry-picked quotes that he mines with search engines.  His effort at the WP:RSN is in line with gaming the system—to get his quotes anointed as "reliable sources". Even when it was pointed out to him that it was not an RS issue, he still wanted to use it.'' I have discussed above how attribution of each views are done as per wp:rsn, the cherry pickings Chaipau referring, his recent view seems [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kamarupi_Prakrit&diff=prev&oldid=889388240&diffmode=source altogether different] ? For mining quotes from search engine comment, he may not sitting besides me when i am editing.I have taken it to wp:rsn to follow [[wp:dispute resolution process]], rather [[wp:edit warring]] which Chaipau seems quite used to. Chaipau intentionally misrepresented the wp:rsn, where they do said issue maybe not of rs although [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=889680864&diffmode=source they are reliable to use], if anybody disagree should be attributed ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=890518124&diffmode=source diff], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=889681029&diffmode=source diff]).   

:*''He tries [[WP:POVFORK]] to include his POV (e.g. [[Ancient Kamrup]] for [[Kamarupa]]).  This pattern of behavior is highly disruptive.'' The example provided is too misleading, although content should not discussed here, to clear [[Ancient Kamrup]] was for ancient history of Kamrup dating several centuries B.C. (references are in article) (see [[Medieval Kamrup]] too), while [[Kamarupa]] more appropriately [[Kamarupa kingdom]] is 4-12th century political entity.  

:*''This pattern of behavior is highly disruptive.  The stunted growth of [[Kamrupi dialect]] since 2012 is itself an example.'' In contrary, for a casual viewer [[Kamrupi dialect]] grown multiple times as compared to [[Kamrupi|original article]] in 2012. 

:*''I shall document this pattern of behavior in more detail below sometime later.''Indeed, diverting the content dispute to behavior issue suits them. It seems a case of [[wp:competence]] on the subject alongside [[wp:Assume_bad_faith|wp:bad faith editing]].[[User:Bhaskarbhagawati|<span style="color: gold">भास्कर् </span><span style="color: red">Bhagawati</span>]] [[User talk:Bhaskarbhagawati|<span style="color: ">Speak</span>]] 14:05, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

*{{reply|Chaipau}} I don't disagree with you regarding the past behavior. Our difference perhaps lies in how to deal with it. Since Bhaskar ''now'' is willing to take the issue to DRN (and not edit the articles/talkpages in the meantime), I think that is worth a try.

***{{reply|Chaipau}} Thanks. Your scepticism is only natural given the experience since 2012. The reason I hold out some hope for DRN is that the volunteer at the board will, hopefully, help keep the discussion focused and not let it devolve into the frustratingly lengthy back-and-forths as has happened in the past. And in case that doesn't work, it will be easier to make the case for community sanctions or [[WP:AC/DS|discretionary sanctions]] under [[WP:ARBIPA]].

[[User:Sheldybett]] will clerk discussions being held at AfD. Unfortunately they seem to have trouble doing this with the competence required for the task. Numerous editors have expressed concerns about their abilities while doing so in the last four months ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASheldybett&type=revision&diff=877195538&oldid=877195009], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASheldybett&type=revision&diff=877051457&oldid=876433134], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASheldybett&type=revision&diff=879962894&oldid=879831175], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASheldybett&type=revision&diff=883144206&oldid=881136941], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASheldybett&type=revision&diff=890014496&oldid=889723327], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASheldybett&type=revision&diff=890936460&oldid=890412892])). The concerns in those diffs, each expressed by a ''different'' editor, include nearly the full range of options available for non-admin actions at AfD. It is possible that this user has trouble with other aspects of editing, as I notice several declines of speedy deletion tags and at least one file they uploaded itself tagged, and one question of hounding, but I admit I have not fully investigated those areas so I can not speak to their validity. {{pb}}However, what is clear to me is their repeated inability to clerk at AfD. This suggests, at minimum, that they should be '''topic banned from clerking at any deletion forum'''. Best, [[User:Barkeep49|Barkeep49]] ([[User_talk:Barkeep49|talk]]) 15:33, 4 April 2019 (UTC)

*'''Support topic ban''' I have no doubt that the editor wants to help, but the issues are persistent, and the editor seems unable or unwilling to address them.

::Hi, [USERNAME]. You are expected to answer the following questions in a clear, honest, and yes/no manner:
::* Are you a member of the organization(s) known as Identity Evropa (IE) or American Identity Movement (AIM)?
::* Are you personally or financially related to IE/AIM or other white nationalist/"Identitarian" groups, or Nathan Damigo, Patrick Casey, and Elliot Kline, in any way?
::If so, you must declare your conflict of interest. Undisclosed editing, especially undisclosed paid editing, are serious violations of our policies. You '''must respond''' to COI inquiries and '''cease editing immediately''' until you have done so.
::The detailed notice is below. Thank you. (Emphasis in original)

: ...followed by the standard [[:Template:uw-coi]] notice.

:To make things worse, he then took these editors to ANI complaning when they blanked the message or posted an angry response. I certainly would have blanked such a message if I had received it. 

:I have no problem with uw-coi notice, but Tsumikiria's added text seem overly aggressive and accusatory for a first contact with a suspected coi editor. It is also factually untrue. No policy says that coi editors "'''must respond''' to COI inquiries and '''cease editing immediately''' until they have done so." It is perfectly acceptable for a coi editor to not declare anything and to instead delete the warning and silently stop editing in the area where he has a coi.

:None of the above implies that these users do or do not have a coi. That only becomes an issue if they continue to edit the pages where they are suspected to have a coi after receiving a warning. --[[User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] ([[User talk:Guy Macon|talk]]) 03:39, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

== Disruptive editor PearlSt82 - re DogsBite.org article ==

[[User:PearlSt82]] is engaging in [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]] in pursuit of [[Wikipedia:Advocacy|pushing a particular agenda or point of view]] on the single article [[Dogsbite.org]]. This has been going on for two months recently, but PearlSt82's hatred for the topic/target of the article (DogsBite.org) is documented in Wikipedia as far back as 2015.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dogsbite.org#PearlSt82's_recorded_history_on_the_topic_of_DogsBite.org]

On 3 Dec 2018, Dwanyewest created the article page 'DogsBite.org' (ending with 3 sentences, 13 citations). PearlSt82 immediately took it over the same day (ending with 5 sentences, 12 citations). I discovered this page in early February 2019 and found it to be a wholey disparaging, [[WP:G10|critical article]]. 

I recommended for [[WP:G10|Speedy Deletion-G10]] (19 Feb 2019). It was denied. 

It got nominated for deletion based on "not notable." Keep.

I attempted to edit the article. For everything I edited, I heavily described/documented on the Talk page, but despite that PearlSt82 continued to revert and/or over-ride my edits, including reverting at least FIVE (5) of my edits in a 24 hour period on 26 Feb 2019. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=885176916&oldid=885176891] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=885177065&oldid=885177023] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=885212140&oldid=885210773] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=885226435&oldid=885226125] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=prev&oldid=885226483] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=885340192&oldid=885332620] Those examples are rather small, but a lot of larger sections were reverted, too, on other days. I think PearlSt82 panicked when faced with a [[WP:3RR|3RR report]] (which I didn't do at the time).

On 25 Feb 2019, Dwanyewest tried to take this to Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard, but it was bounced back as not an appropriate avenue.

On 4 Mar 2019, Dwanyewest suggested WP:Thirdopinion.

On 6 Mar 2019, PearlSt82 filed on "Dispute Resolution Noticeboard" but that sat for weeks with no comments and timed out on 24 Mar 2019.

I guess it automatically went to RFC (request for comment) right after that, but no one is interested in joining in this discussion because (a) it's esoteric and unless you're involved in the subject, it's confusing, and (b) the Talk page is LITTERED with voluminous discussions and comments.

Yesterday & today I attempted to re-work the article, bring in new information, and I addressed PearlSt82's most recent complaints he'd made on the Talk page. Nope. He reverted MY ENTIRE WORK. (That's not the first time he's done that.) I confess to reverting it right back, because I considered his blanket reversion to be vandalism. There's nothing in my work that is false, inflammatory or libelous, and everything I wrote was well cited. On the other hand, PearlSt82's edits continuously bring in contentious material (citations that attack DogsBite.org), writes personal opinion, and adds his own original research (some of which has been the subject of at least two [[Wikipedia:Libel|libel reports to Wikipedia]]).

There has been ZERO concensus between PearlSt82 and myself (Nomopbs), and zero cooperation on PearlSt82's part. At least I've tried to bring the article closer to NPOV numerous times, but PearlSt82 keeps destroying my work or involving yet another administrative process. I suppose his intention is to wear me down or plow me under. I don't know. But no matter how softly I word my change-explanations, nothing seems to soften PearlSt82 or get any sort of cooperation whatsoever.

'''I have probably spent well over 10 times MORE time and effort addressing PearlSt82's complaints, edits, and reversions on this one article than I have spent doing work on the article!''' I am NOT exaggerating. And that level of disruptive editing is completely unacceptable.

Maybe since PearlSt82 HATES DogsBite.org, and has for so long, he should be prohibited from editing that page. I don't kow what else to do about it.

===Discussion===
:I vehemently disagree my edits are disruptive as I have made good faith efforts to gain consensus through various means. My count for my reverts on Feb 26 is 2, not 5, and I have taken all further edits regarding that series to the talk page and only have edited the article space again today. In none of my edits have I made OR, or expressed my personal opinion, but rather every edit I made has been reliably sourced, and has been a good faith reflection of the sources. Nomopbs' username appears to be an abbreviation of "No more pitbulls", and they are a [[WP:SPA]] that is only concerned with pushing an anti-[[Pit bull]]/pro-[[Breed specific legislation]] POV through various pages, including [[dogsbite.org]] and [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]]. I have no idea what they are talking about regarding libel reports. On [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]] they have recently added [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States&type=revision&diff=889208792&oldid=889174076 a list of bulleted cherry picked primary studies] without attempting to discuss or gain consensus. Their talk page comments are steeped in numerous bad faith assumptions, [[WP:BATTLEGROUND]] behavior, and an egregious misreading of core wikipedia policies. One of the more absurd misreadings of WP policy is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard&type=revision&diff=886913148&oldid=886896112&diffmode=source this edit] to [[WP:DRN]] where they state that my proposed wording on [[dogsbite.org]]'s history section "exposes [my] true [[WP:G10]] purposes".

*{{yo|Nomopbs}} your [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&oldid=889614931 version of the Dogsbite.org] reads more like a promotional piece about the website, that the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&oldid=887751231 previous version]. I'd suggest reverting the rewrite, and then proposing ''individual'' changes on the article talkpage. Secondly, given your username (as CatainEek spotted), and your [https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/Nomopbs editing-history], do you have any [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] with respect to the website or the issue it advocates for?

* Wow, you guys are funny. The meaning of my username is personal and private, but I like your version. Maybe I should adopt it as my 'forward facing' persona. Anyone who has reviewed my edits on [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]] could easily see that I give equal attention to fatalities caused by non-pit bull dogs as by pit bulls. If more of the entries are about pit bulls, it's because there are more deaths by pit bulls, apparently. That's not my fault; I report it like I see it. So y'all know, I do not have a website or an organization about pit bulls (pro or con), I do not work for any organization, I'm not paid by anyone to do what I do in Wikipedia, nor even encouraged. I get a lot of flak about it from my friends because I jumped in with both feet, barely come up for air... but I haven't yet drowned. It's how I am with topics I'm intensely interested in. I've been using Wikipedia for years but didn't know anyone could sign up to be an editor until last fall. I've been through some learning curves and feel pretty confident about my grasp of the policies at this point. PearlSt82 has been a trial by fire, though. No one should have to fight a diehard like that as a novice wiki editor. I got interested in the deaths and discovered that the wiki page [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]] was missing about half of the fatalities. I set about locating information on the missing ones and adding them. I wanted a complete list. I liked that the wiki page was a summary of everything all in one place. (Should have been, if for the fact it was missing half the deaths.) I didn't realize I was going to get sucked into an entire world of controversy. Sure, I used the website dogsbite.org as a research tool, but it isn't the only resource I used. Now I've moved on to the academic/scientific/medical studies in order to identify the causes and possible solutions to the problem. At least I'm ''trying'' to move on but keep getting sucked back into this. [[User:Nomopbs|Nomopbs]] ([[User talk:Nomopbs|talk]]) 02:46, 27 March 2019 (UTC)
*While revisiting the talk page and the glut of new comments, I did notice something interesting that may provide some insight into COI. On February 25th, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dogsbite.org&type=revision&diff=885112643&oldid=885108458&diffmode=source pointed out] that the term "science whores" was still on a dogsbite.org branded website, which [https://web.archive.org/web/20190227060759/https://maultalk.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/science-whores/ at the time] contained a large banner at the top that says "The Maul Talk Manual is endorsed by dogsbite.org and authored by members of our community", a the "dogsbite.org term" metatag as well as a "sponsored by dogsbite.org" banner on the right side. Nomopbs responded [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dogsbite.org&type=revision&diff=885447496&oldid=885363429&diffmode=source here] by saying that the comment was "posted 9-years ago by someone else on a blog that is now an archive and not active". If you [https://maultalk.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/science-whores/ now look at the live version of the site], all mentions of dogsbite.org have been scrubbed - the top banner, the right nav, and the "dogsbite.org term" metatag are all gone. As the site was inactive for 9 years, I find it very hard to believe that its just coincidence this material was removed just a few weeks after the discussion about the term and how reliable sources discuss the term took place. Its certainly circumstantial, but would suggest to me some form off-wiki coordination and COI. [[User:PearlSt82|PearlSt82]] ([[User talk:PearlSt82|talk]]) 22:51, 27 March 2019 (UTC)

:Looking over this for fifteen minutes, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=884021626&oldid=882644543 This edit] suggests basic misunderstanding of Wikipedia policy.  It removes citation of a news article that details problems with the site's data collection (to be sure, the nitpicks do sound minor - if they hand-pick half a dozen cases and they include things like somebody getting killed by a car while fleeing from two pit bulls, I don't see that as tremendously wrong.  Also inevitable [[selection bias]])  The edit summary says ''Opinion piece cited violated NPOV and directly refutes actual facts in the case. See http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/two-pit-bulls-maul-a-helpless-man/article49136.html''.  Now it should be totally clear that ''sources'' cannot violate NPOV, only editors.  And editors violate NPOV when they play at saying "this source is wrong, this source is right" rather than including both sources and describing their contradictions!  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=884675377&oldid=884672913 This one] is not much better, deleting a newspaper's editorial in its own voice saying "WP:RS".  The dispute apparently began on [[Pit bull]], where in June 2018 PearlSt82 made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pit_bull&diff=847819768&oldid=847818312 this reversion] of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pit_bull&diff=847818312&oldid=847816888 this edit] by [[User:Michaelandsandy]] (pinging in case they can tell us more about the past history here) and reinserted a blanket statement that pit bulls are not any more dangerous than any other kind of dog. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pit_bull&diff=848337162&oldid=848328770]  This may be one of the reversions mentioned by Nomopbs on the dogsbite talk page.  Odd part is PealSt82 ended up removing a very old but relevant page of statistics to support his own argument (i.e. the CDC found that Rottweilers caused more fatalities in the mid-90s) [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&diff=885226435&oldid=885226125 here] because it was in the wrong place in the article.  I am suspicious that this was indeed a dispute predating the article, with strong opinions on both sides, however, those two edits by Nomopbs clearly misinterpret policy.

Neither did PearlSt82 come on my radar until I discovered the [[Dogsbite.org]] article (Feb 2019). Indeed, the entirety of the Talk:DogsBite.org page is only 38 days old.

However that work involved deleting (one might say 'destroying') what appears to be a meticulously sourced 'Criticism' section. PearlSt82's reversion was equal parts removing newly added content and restoring previous content, which is not the impression given by Nomopbs's statement. 
:Looking at the talk page, the only incivility I see is from Nomopbs. Thrice they accuse editors of "wasting everyone's time". Their responses in discussions often come off as combative or sarcastic: "OMG, are you kidding me?", "LOL. There's nothing untrue about that statement", "I guess you can't be assuaged.

[[User:Colin M|Colin M]] ([[User talk:Colin M|talk]]) 00:38, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

=== Nomopbs' edit history on Wikipedia (versus PearlSt82's ad hominem attacks) ===

Let's look at '''wiki's statistics''' (editor contributions), instead of simply jumping on PearlSt82's bandwagon and adding to his smearing my wiki reputation with an [[ad hominem]] attack. 

:'''''[[Ad hominem]]''': is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead <u>attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person</u> making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.''

PearlSt82 asserts that I'm anti pit bull, however...

* PearlSt82's wiki statistics [https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/PearlSt82#top-edited-pages] show that PearlSt82 has made 108 edits to the [[Pit bull]] page, 44 to [[Dogsbite.org]] (whom P considers is anti-pit bull), and the rest mainly to "men's rights movement" type pages.

* Nomopbs' wiki statistics [https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/Nomopbs#top-edited-pages] show I have made 290 edits to the [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]] page, 40 to [[Dogsbite.org]] and a bunch of miscellany. I have made ZERO edits to the [[pit bull]] page, and just 6 edits (link maintenance) to the [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] page.

So tell me... Which editor is looking like a pit bull advocate? And which editor is NOT looking anti-pit bull?

'''Destructive editing:'''

* Going backwards in time, the last 8 edits PearlSt82 made to the pit bull page were REVERTS, earlier was 2 contributions, 3 reverts, 1 contribution, 3 reverts, then 2 contributions. 
* PearlSt82's last biggest contribution on that page was the removal of 11,612 characters,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pit_bull&diff=703990437&oldid=703990300] ''an entire section'' of 'studies about pit bulls', the majority of which pointed to them being dangerous and implicated them in a higher percentage of attacks than their population percentage indicated.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pit_bull&oldid=703990300#Studies] That was in 2016. 
* PearlSt82 did the same thing in 2015. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pit_bull&diff=prev&oldid=657369386] 

That's a lot of destruction and not a lot of construction.

Whether or not the reverts were warranted isn't my point. What I'm saying is that in the last three years, PearlSt82 destroyed/removed/reverted more than he contributed (on the pit bull topic). Why? Are the majority of his 108 edits even more years back when he established the page and now he's taken ownership of it ([[WP:OWN]]) and is guarding the pit bull article against all comers who might say something unflattering about pit bulls? Scroll further to see the full extent of PearlSt82's reversions on the pit bull page:[https://xtools.wmflabs.org/topedits/en.wikipedia.org/PearlSt82/0/Pit_bull] What you'll see is a long series of reverts. Why these edits? What is he protecting? Does he work for one of the organizations that promotes pit bulls as family pets and pays for research to show they are "no different than any other dog"? 

The article [[Dogsbite.org]], though created by editor Dwanyewest, was immediately taken over by PearlSt82. Every single one of his edits contributes only to "criticism" of DogsBite.org as an organization. He has contributed nothing constructive or even neutral. He has railed against all of my contructive or neutral edits on that page. A little bit about DogsBite.org (based on what I see in their website and have read about online): they collect information on fatal dog attacks, they post statistics about such attacks, post that pit bulls are the majority breed involved, post proposed solutions to the pit bull problem including breed specific legislation, and it could be said they are anti-pit bull. Considering PearlSt82's edits on the pit bull page, and the POV you can conclude from those edits, I can see why he must only write criticism on the DogsBite.org article. But that doesn't make it right. And it doesn't excuse his reversions, nor his disruptive editing against me.

'''Constructive editing:'''

On the other hand, I have been a heavy contributor to the [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]] article. My edits have been "constructive" (adding text), rather than "destructive" (removing text) or "inhibitive" (reverting). And I don't discriminate between incidents with pit bulls versus non pit bulls. Here [https://xtools.wmflabs.org/topedits/en.wikipedia.org/Nomopbs/0/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States] is my log of edits to the fatalities pages, just search for "added victim" (from the edit summary column). The last 10 additions I made of victims (in reverse chronological order) were deaths caused by the breeds Rottweiler, Rottweiler, Unspecified, Pits & mixes, Presa Canario, Great Dane, American Bulldog, Pit mix, Pit bull, and German Shepherd. I have added 158,203 bytes to that article and deleted 9,666 bytes (less than 1% of my addition count). Now THAT is a lot of work. If I hated pit bulls, wouldn't I have been adding only fatalities caused by pit bulls (to increase the percentages)? Wouldn't I have quit spending so much time researching, getting citations and writing new entries for fatalities caused by non-pit bulls? It takes about 30 minutes of work for each single fatality I add, and I've added dozens, maybe even a 100 by now. I have been a valuable contributor to Wikipedia on this topic. The fatalities page got so long, someone split it in half (made another page). And then later split it again. So now there are three wiki pages to cover all the fatalies by dog in the USA. 

Anyone who spent 5 minutes looking into (not 'at') my contributions/edit history would have seen my neutral POV with respect to pit bulls. If my agenda was to push an anti-pit bull POV, then I would have been done with my work on the [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States|Fatalities page]] long ago. This disruption by PearlSt82 re [[Dogsbite.org]] is just a sideline distraction that is keeping me from my real work. 

'''Disruptive editing:'''

PearlSt82 only used an [[ad hominem]] personal attack to get me out of his way, to try to get me banned for [[WP:SPA]] or [[WP:COI]], and to try to get sympathetic support for his viewpoint against me (to obtain a false concensus; not based on facts). PearlSt82 accused me above of being ''"a [[WP:SPA]] that is only concerned with pushing an anti-[[Pit bull]]/pro-[[Breed specific legislation]] POV through various pages."'' However, there is no evidence that I have made ANY anti-pit bull edits, NOR ANY pro BSL edits. He has failed to support his claims. His 'smoke and mirrors' contribute to my claim that PearlSt82 has been [[WP:DISRUPTIVE]] (as he was in 2015 on this very same subject!).

Four years ago, PearlSt82 displayed in great detail his [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruptive]] behavior about DogsBite.org in a 2015 discussion on the Reliable Source Noticeboard. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_188#Huffington_Post] It involved EIGHT OTHER wiki editors ([[User:Epeefleche]], [[User:AndyTheGrump]], [[User:EvergreenFir]], [[User:Blueboar]], [[User:DrFleischman]], [[User:GRuban]], [[User:Arkon]], [[User:RightCowLeftCoast]]) and no one took PearlSt82's side. PearlSt82 was combative, refusing to get their points, continued to argue "content" instead of RS, and wasn't interested in concensus. For whatever reason, or for no reason whatsoever, PearlSt82 is rabidly opposed to DogsBite.org, and has been since at least 2015. Which is why I groan when PearlSt82 posts (for the umpteenth time) about trying to get concensus on the issue today, when his opinions and behavior towards THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT hasn't changed in four years despite other editors chiming in.

When is enough enough? When will the disruption end?<br>

::This is exactly the [[WP:BATTLEGROUND]] behavior I was referring to in my initial response. I find this bit: ''Why these edits? What is he protecting? Does he work for one of the organizations that promotes pit bulls as family pets and pays for research to show they are "no different than any other dog"? '' particularly telling, as this is the exact same line of thought Dogsbite.org has been criticized for by RS, and is what Nomopbs [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dogsbite.org&type=revision&diff=889631530&oldid=889628962&diffmode=source has objected to], in part calling it libel. In light of this libel accusation on the talk page after the ANI report was filed, I'm a bit concerned by this phrase in Nomopbs' initial ANI filing: ''PearlSt82's edits continuously bring in contentious material (citations that attack DogsBite.org), writes personal opinion, and adds his own original research (some of which has been the subject of at least two [[Wikipedia:Libel|libel reports to Wikipedia]])'' - what do they mean when they say "at least two" reports? How do they arrive at a figure of multiple filed reports, but an indeterminate number? Are they saying that they themselves have filed multiple reports? Or do they know of others that have filed reports? If the latter, how do they know this? [[User:PearlSt82|PearlSt82]] ([[User talk:PearlSt82|talk]]) 11:26, 2 April 2019 (UTC)

===The evidence, the proof===

Apparently I have been unable to adequately explain what is going on, because of the esoteric nature of the "content". So today, I undertook research to identify the types and patterns of edits made by PearlSt82, without getting involved in specific content issues. 
The primary patterns I saw were "revert or remove" and "state critical opinions about DogsBite.org on Talk pages".

'''Reverts/removals in general:'''

On PearlSt82's top 9 edited pages,[https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/PearlSt82#top-edited-pages] P totaled 286 edit. 163 (57%) were reverts/removals.
* [[Pit bull]]: Out of 108 edits, at least 53 (49%) were reverts/removals.
* [[Dogsbite.org]]: Out of 44 edits, at least 12 (27%) were reverts/removals.
* [[Men's rights movement]]: 32 edits, 28 (88%) of those are reverts/removals.
* [[Roosh V]]: 25 edits, 15 (60%) are reverts/removals. One "Nominated for deletion".
* [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]]: Out of 20 edits, 13 (65%) were reverts/removals. 
* [[Masculinism]]: 17 edits. 14 (82%) reverts/removals.
* [[A Voice for Men]]: 17 edits. 11 (65%) reverts/removals.
* [[Breed-specific legislation]]: Out of 13 edits, 10 (77%) involved reverts/removals.
* [[Manosphere]]: 10 edits. 7 (70%) reverts/removals.

This pattern of heavy reverts violates Wikipedia's editor policies about reverts (why, why not, when, and how). In summary, reversions are considered to be hostile, drive away editors, and make editing Wikipedia unpleasant. [[WP:ONLYREVERT]] There is a whole slew of wiki guidelines on how better to make changes than to revert, including [[Wikipedia:Alternatives to reversion|Alternatives to reversion]].

'''Deliberately seeking out mentions of DogsBite.org in Wikipedia (to remove):'''

* On a single day (Jan 18, 2017) PearlSt82 made exactly 7 edits. '''ALL''' of them were to remove references to  DogsBite.org from all around Wikipedia, including 5 removals from [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States&diff=prev&oldid=760743027]  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States&diff=prev&oldid=760744706] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States&diff=prev&oldid=760744960] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States&diff=prev&oldid=760745181] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States&diff=prev&oldid=760745492], 1 from [[Greyhound]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greyhound&diff=prev&oldid=760743737], and 1 from [[Dog fighting]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dog_fighting_in_the_United_States&diff=prev&oldid=760744124].

* One of those 7 removals [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/760744706] had been there for '''9 months''', created on April 18, 2016 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States&diff=next&oldid=715912492].

* On the [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]] page that PearlSt82 had made 20 edits and 13 were reverts/removals, '''9 out of 13''' were in order to remove DogsBite.org as a citation or when it was mentioned. 

* Three of the reverts on the [[pit bull]] page were remarked as being to remove DogsBite.org as a citation.

'''Talk pages, vilifying DogsBite.org:'''

Considering the dearth of actual constructive edits, on the other hand the Talk pages are filled with lots of commentary about why this or that should be removed or this or that should be a certain way. According to [[WP:TALK]] ''"Article talk pages should not be used by editors as platforms for their personal views on a subject."''

* On the pit bull Talk page, PearlSt82 vilifies DogsBite for the last SIX YEARS: 31 January 2013, 17 February 2014, 20 April 2015 X 3, 25 January 2017, 2 July 2018.

* On the Talk page for [[Fatal dog attacks in the United States]], PearlSt82 vilifies DogsBite.org: 22 April 2015, 28 September 2015

* The entirety of P's discussion on [[Talk:Dogsbite.org]] is critical of DogsBite.org. In fact, the [[Dogsbite.org|article]] was created as a criticism piece,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dogsbite.org&oldid=882644543] and it wasn't until I came along that anyone tried to bring it towards NPOV.

'''PearlSt82 publishes his opinions of DogsBite.org:'''

Do you really think someone with these opinions could possibly maintain any sense of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] while editing the [[Dogsbite.org]] article?

* "Dogsbite.org is a anti-Pit bull, pro-Breed Specific Legislation advocacy group. They have a vested interest in skewing statistics regarding dog bite fatalities in order to make pit bulls look more dangerous than they are" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_188]

* "'''I disagree that my views on dogsbite.org is personal opinion.''' It is a fact dogsbite.org is not peer reviewed. It is a fact that it is self published. It is a fact that Colleen Lynn, the sole operator of dogsbite.org has no credentials in veterinary science, animal behavior or other related matters that would make her reliable for quoting these kinds of statistics from. It is also fact that HuffPo wrote an article which I quoted above that labels Lynn and Merritt Clifton as academic frauds.

* "How is this not a fringe organization?" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_188]

* "I think this is absolutely not reliable information. Dogsbite.org is a self published source which has been known to skew its statistics. It is run by a single person, Colleen Lynn, who has no professional experience in animal behavior. It is not peer reviewed. All of their dog bite statistics come from media reports" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_188]

* "'''How would we approach without running afoul of NPOV and [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|BLP]] when discussing Lynn?'''" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pit_bull/Archive_9]

Does anyone still think the author of the above statements could possibly edit the [[Dogsbite.org]] article with a neutral point of view? I can only conclude that this person ''must'' have some sort of vested interest. ''No one'' would spend six years making absolutely sure that nothing is ever said positive about a single small organization unless they saw themselves as some sort of competitor (like National Canine Research Council) or they work for one of the large pit bull advocacy organizations such as Animal Farm Foundation, Best Friends Animal Society, etc. Not even someone with a personal grudge against Lynn could cook up the lengthy and detailed arguments against her work like PearlSt82 has done. The hours and weeks P must have spent on this over the years. Oh my! <small>(And I had to go get myself sucked into the quicksand of this rivalry. Beating myself up now for getting involved.)</small>

'''To sum it up:'''

I accidentally encountered PearlSt82 when I tried to edit the [[Dogsbite.org]] article. Working with, or around, PearlSt82 has been excruciating. Apparently I could not adequately explain to others what was going on. I hope that this summary of P's edits has sufficiently shown that P has been engaged in [[WP:DISRUPTIVE|DISRUPTIVE EDITING]] for a very long time, and specifically on the subject of DogsBite.org — though not disruptive exclusively towards DogsBite, but also as a general pattern of his type of editing. '''Considering P's <u>documented</u> focused attacks on the target DogsBite for an <u>extended period of time (six years) without break</u>, PearlSt82 should be banned or blocked from editing the [[Dogsbite.org]] article.'''<br>

::I somewhat agree with PearlSt82. This is a true wall of text, and this horse feels pretty well flogged. I did go through however and read this large block of text. While reverting shouldn't be the main way of editing, many editors still do revert a great deal. Why you brought up Pearls non-dog edits seems to be confusing the issue. Deliberately removing DogsBites mentions? Thats no crime, and in fact I support Pearl's edits in that area: per [[WP:BLOGS]], a website like DogsBite is hardly a reliable source. On talk pages: reading through the talk page, I see no egregious problems. If you'd like to provide specific diffs or sections, please do. I hardly find evidence of them "villifying" DogsBite. And from what I can see, they don't seem wildly or unfairly prejudiced against DogsBite. They claim that its a fringe source, and I think they may be right. Its certainly not a reliable source. Perhaps that issue would be better raised at the RS noticeboard. Their view that DogsBite isn't reliable seems backed, or at least not just their opinion.
::At this point, I see that there is a clear issue between PearlSt82 and Nomopbs. Perhaps an [[WP:IBAN]] is in order? Otherwise, I say that Nomopbs should probably step back from Dog articles (with a topic ban if necessary). PearlSt82 could also step back, but their edits do not seem overly problematic to me. That, or per [[WP:STICK]], this horse is well and truly flogged, you should both accept that this thing is over, and maybe stop editing the article and go find another article to work on.

== BLP ban lift ==

I'm not blocked per se, but there is a ban from editing BLP pages. 10 months ago I was told I could appeal in 6 months.

I remember being told that it would be a good idea to edit pages within that restriction before appealing. I've done that a little.

When I appealed on my talk page 2 months ago (which was not place to appeal) I was told that some of my edits flirted with BLP violation because although the pages being edited weren't BLP pages, they were connected to some. I accept that criticism.

On my talk page I was told to appeal via email (to arbcom), which I did, and the replying email said to appeal here.

I request the BLP ban be lifted. I've done a lot of very good editing before, but then I got into edit wars which led to the ban. [[User:Iistal|Iistal]] ([[User talk:Iistal|talk]]) 01:54, 7 April 2019 (UTC)

:To provide some context to other visitors, the ban is an [[WP:ER/UC]] issued [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&diff=prev&oldid=740306601 here]. After being unblocked with those restrictions in September 2016, Iistal was checkuser blocked in November 2016, before being unblocked in May 2018, having accepted the [[WP:SO]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&page=User%3AIistal block log]. The topic ban was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=846502233#Iistal "restated"] and the user was blocked for a month in June 2018 for violating it by editing [[Barbara Streisand]].

Their attitude is clear from their user page, and a combination of POV and incompetence is demonstrated on [[Talk:Intifada]] and edits such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crimes_against_humanity_under_Communist_regimes&diff=prev&oldid=890044775 this], where [https://www.webcitation.org/5yf88YFCY?url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 this strange document], and maybe a link to a primary document (unnecessary since the Prague Declaration was already linked), are enough to remove a POV label, without making their case on the talk page.

::explain to me how a document stating that Communism and nazism are equatable is not a good source for the statement that Communism and nazism are equal? Is this for real? And how is my page more "pov" from theirs which publically states their support for the groups they're editing articles about? Am I the only one who doesn't see a huge bias here? And can you explain how the sources that say the YPG committed mass deportations against Arab villages don't support the statement that the YPG committed mass deportations against Arab villages? Now I know these questions aren't going to be answered but I want you to think about them the next time you try and act like WP is an objective website that promotes free unbiased knowledge. I already cancelled my annual donation because of you Drmies, I began to reconsider until encountering the blatant biases and POV pushing by Tsumikiria and apparently now backed up by you. 
::This is why the co-founder of wp was so appalled by the state of some articles that showed a very clear bias in favor of progressive leftism. And the admin staff who do not give two shits about it and actively encourage it while instabanning anyone who tries to put in sourced material as long as it's not supporting the leftist narrative. No wonder so many editors are leaving. Why would they want to stay if this is the fate of those who want an unbiased and informative platform?

Would someone mind speedy-closing the first discussion at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2019 March 30]] and sanctioning the nominator?  Two editors, including me, have demonstrated that the nomination and initial supporting votes are in error (the nominator misunderstood a category for a region as being a category for a single city in that region, and the other voters thought the same), which is the basis for requesting [[WP:SKEEP]] #3.  Moreover, in response to my saying that the whole nomination is in error, the nominator has proceeded to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=890802484 attack me] for ''one of the most risible and disingenuous exercises in wikilawyering I have seen in a long time'' and ''bad faith, timewasting and wordplay of deliberately-missing-the-point crap''.  We block newbies for such attacks; there is no room for tolerating it in anyone else.  [[User:Nyttend backup|Nyttend backup]] ([[User talk:Nyttend backup|talk]]) 18:07, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

:*@[[User:Legacypac|Legacypac]], The reason I am angry is ''not'' because of the categories. Some nominations gain consensus, some don't, and I'm used to that.  What angers me here is the disruptiveness and blatant bad faith of Nyttend's attempt to wiklawyer a speedy close over a difference of interpretation of ambiguous category titles which — no matter which interpretation is chosen — do not alter the fact the UAE categories are too small to split, per [[WP:SMALLCAT]] and [[WP:NARROWCAT]].  The fact that Nyttend says below that they actually agree with this substantive issue on which my  nomination is based makes the the disruptiveness of the wikilawyering even more risible. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 18:49, 3 April 2019 (UTC)
*PS, if this is speedy closed, I'm happy to open a new nomination for the same categories on the grounds that these categories are too small without reasonable chance for expansion.  (The nominator said such a thing in discussion in the middle of the nomination.)  I don't have an opinion on this question, so the nomination would be procedural/neutral.  [[User:Nyttend backup|Nyttend backup]] ([[User talk:Nyttend backup|talk]]) 18:25, 3 April 2019 (UTC)
:*'''Reply''' More nonsense from Nyttend, and a blatant misrepresentation of the nomination.  The size issue is the very basis of my nomination, and it is explicitly set out in the first two paras of the nominator's rationale, which I reproduce here in full:
::::{{tq|Nominator's rationale: per WP:NARROWCAT, upmerge year and decade categories for Abu Dhabi to the equivalent category for the United Arab Emirates or its predecessor the Trucial States.<br/>The merge targets are all quite small. AFAICS, the biggest category after the merge will be Category:2013 establishments in the United Arab Emirates , which will grow from 14 to 18 articles ... and most of the merge targets will still have less than ten articles.}}
::I don't know whether Nyttend has somehow failed to notice that per "WP:NARROWCAT" is the first two words of the nomination, or is trying to misrepresent it in the hope that others will not check.
::But either way, Nyttend's claim that I only {{tq|said such a thing in discussion in the middle of the nomination}} is plainly false.  What on earth does Nyttend hope to gain by coming to ANI and asserting falsehoods? --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 18:37, 3 April 2019 (UTC)
*'''Wow!'''  Nyttend escalates the wikilawyering to a new level.
:My CFD nomination at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2019 March 30#Years_and_decades_in_Abu_Dhabi]] is based on the categories being too small.  The point about Abu Dhabi being a city is not mentioned until the 8th sentence of the nomination, and it is a subsidiary point to the main thrust of the nomination.
:In hindsight, there is ambiguity about whether the intend scope of the categories is the Emirate or the city; it could be read either way, and I would be happy to clarify that in the nomination.
:However, as Nyttend is very well aware, it is almost irrelevant which view is correct. This is a [[distinction without a difference]], for two reasons:
:# The city has a population of 1.8 million, out the Emirate's total of 2.3 million.  So expanding the category to the whole Emirate makes little difference to the number of articles in scope, esp since most notable events are linked to cities
:#regardless of which definition is used, the fact remains that these are all smallcats. Only 5 of the 72 categories nominated for merger contains five or more pages; and the largest single category which will be created by the merger will contain only 18 pages.
:For whatever reason, Nyttend has chosen to ignore the sound numerical basis for the nomination, and to engage in a bout if disruptive wikilawyering with the explicit intent of derailing an entire well-founded nomination on the basis of difference of interpretation of an ambiguous title.  Instead of engaging with the substantive issue of the UAE categories being too small to split, Nyttend has chosen to engage in obfuscation through petty point-scoring.
:I applied [[WP:SPADE]], and I stand by description of Nyttend's conduct as '''bad faith, timewasting and wordplay of deliberately-missing-the-point crap'''.
:I repeat that is shameful for an admin such as Nyttend to disrupt a consensus-forming discussion in this way. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 18:29, 3 April 2019 (UTC)
* Whilst agreeing that BHG should tone down the rhetoric, when looking at the CfD itself I am in agreement that the categories are ambiguous and could possibly do with being split.  As such, continuing the CfD may be useful in order to gain some sort of consensus about what should be done with the category(ies).  Incidentally, there's something awry with our population estimates; as BHG says, the article says that 1.8m of 2.3m live in the city, but [[Al-Ain]] says that the population of that city alone is 766,000.  Something doesn't add up there.  [[User_talk:Black Kite|Black Kite (talk)]] 18:36, 3 April 2019 (UTC)
**What would be the point of splitting the UAE categories?

*** Yes, that was unclear.  See Fayenatic's comment, in that the "city" articles could simply be in the already existing "Abu Dhabi" category whilst the wider one may or may not be necessary.  Anyway, this isn't the page to discuss the technicalities of the actual cats, so I'll comment at the CFD later. [[User_talk:Black Kite|Black Kite (talk)]] 18:46, 3 April 2019 (UTC)
*'''Previous history'''.  I have had little interaction with Nyttend,  but I just recalled [[WP:Categories for discussion/Log/2019 February 16#North_Macedonia]].  Nyttend was quick off the mark there with a bunch of unfounded procedural objections about that mass nomination of ~650 categories would have terrible procedural effects.    All of Nyttend's objections there were misplaced; nobody speedy-closed the discussion, and the discussion concluded after 16 days with an overwhelming consensus to rename the lot.
:Is it just coincidence that this is the second time in 7 weeks that Nyttend has tried a convoluted procedural argument to derail a group nomination by me?
:It is especially odd that it is happening here, where Nyttend now says that they agree with my substantial analysis, and explicitly wants to reopen the discussion under their own rationale, which it turns out would basically be rewrite of the first 8 sentences of mine.
:I can speculate about many possible reasons why Nyttend would want to do this, but I can't see any credible explanation which would be part of a good faith effort to assist consensus formation. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 19:06, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I see no reason for speedy closing anything since there still seems to be valid issues of discussion. The issue over whether the category is for the city or the emirate seems to be under active discussion. This may entail a move. Ideally probably [[WP:RM]] should have been used for that. But there also seem to be some who feel it doesn't matter and the category should be deleted regardless. Hopefully these can both be resolved in the CSD. If the CSD only comes to a consensus on whether to keep the category and that decision is keep or keep for the emirate only, then an RM can be started if people feel it's necessary. While I don't hang out at XfD, AFAIK it's hardly uncommon that discussions are started with imperfect opening messages. But even when that happens, we don't normally close them provided there are valid issues to discuss. People can clarify any points of confusion in the discussion, and any unclarified !votes based on misunderstandings can be ignored. I'm actually even more confused about the purpose of the suggestion since Nyttend seem to explicitly acknowledge that there were still valid issues to discussion when they suggested re-opening. Frankly I can understand the boomerang suggestions unless Nyttend can explain better WTF the purpose of this thread is. (And I'm sorry but whatever the problems with BHG's language, it's difficult for people to care when the discussion starts off with what seems to be a completely pointless suggestion.)

:::Also I wasn't that aware of the norms for CfD. Based on other comments and having looked into it more, it seems it's the norm to use CfD for renaming categories anyway. So I see even less reason why the CfD should be closed. I would note that even in [[WP:RfC]]s where the opening comment is required to be neutral, it's not necessarily a good idea to close it just because the opening statement was imperfect. It can sometimes be better to just reword it and notify anyone who has already participated. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] ([[User talk:Nil Einne|talk]]) 13:33, 4 April 2019 (UTC)
* I do not see a need of closing (an particularly speedy closing) the nomination. CfD means categories for '''discussion''' (in contrast e.g. to AfD being articles for '''deletion'''), and it is not uncommon that discussions provide some good alternatives not though of by a nominator. If anybody feels there is a better solution that what was proposed by the nominator, they should just add their arguments and explain why their solution is better. Closing a CfD and then renominating the cats usually does not make much sense, it is easier to keep the discussion in one place. Having said that, I would kindly ask both Nyttend and BHG to tone down a bit. It is highly unlikely that this thread would result in personal sanctions against any of you, and we have already enough accusations in disruption and bad faith in the air and do not need new ones.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 10:45, 4 April 2019 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - it is not unusual for cfd discussions to become fractious but it is most unusual for one editor to urge closure and relisting on the grounds of superior understanding of the issues involved. This reminds me of M Thatcher, who would find herself more logical than anyone else in the room. [[User:Oculi|Oculi]] ([[User talk:Oculi|talk]]) 11:28, 4 April 2019 (UTC)
*It's exceptionally poor form to drag a monumentally experienced editor to AN/I over a contested XfD, suggesting that their nomination is so erroneous that the only possible explanation is that they have no idea what they're talking about, and that they need to be force-closed and sanctioned. I can't find any actual grounds for this request, and this seems to be the sort of petty "run to ANI" behavior that we expect from immature newbies. BHG is clearly providing nuanced refutations that show there is a legitimate disagreement stemming from the ambiguity of the intent of the categories, so to frame her as being objectively in error is fairly insulting.

{{hat|I really don't see any action, admin or not, coming out of this, so hatting per [[WP:DENY]]. Feel free to remove the section entirely if that's better. [[User:Ansh666|ansh]][[User talk:Ansh666|<span style="font-size:80%">''666''</span>]] 21:34, 9 April 2019 (UTC)}}
A couple of months ago, while patrolling [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]] for vandalism as normal, I spotted a disruptive vandal by the name of “[[User:Wolly on Whools|Wolly on Whools]]”. Attempting to convince this user to stop his vandalism, I gave him a few warnings, and then promptly reported him to [[WP:AIV|AIV]] when he would not listen. Having not previously known about the [[WP:DENY]] policy, I also opened an [[WP:SPI|SPI]] for him under [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/BMX On WheeIs]] and tagged him as a [[Template:Sockpuppet|suspected sockpuppet]].

Within a few minutes at most, Wolly was globally locked, and the SPI was closed per [[WP:DUCK]]. But later, when I took a closer look at BMX On WheeIs’s [[WP:LTA/BMX|long-term abuse page]], I noticed that I shouldn’t have reported him to SPI or tagged him at all, per [[WP:DENY]]. At this point, I figured that the damage had been done; although I wasn’t entirely comfortable with blanking an entire section of his SPI page, I did the best I could and nominated Wolly’s user page for speedy deletion under the [[WP:G7|G7 criteria]], thereby removing the tags. The speedy deletion nomination was successful, and Wolly’s user page was no more.

I forgot about the whole pizzazz until recently, when I noticed that Wolly’s userpage had somehow been fully restored by another user by the name of [[User:Kirbanzo|Kirbanzo]]. Everything that had been previously present before the deletion was now up again, tags and all, and I didn’t know why. I got the userpage deleted again and warned Kirbanzo. While what he was doing was technically against Wikipedia policy, he has always been against vandalism, having been actively removing it in a constructive manner. Still, I find it quite unusual that he’d restored the userpage for a long-gone user out of practically nowhere. Therefore, I am confused as to whether he happened to stumble upon Wolly randomly (either by scrolling through BMX’s SPI page, entering BMX’s suspected socks category, or some other method), or whether something a little more fishy is going on, to say the least.

However, when I came to look at BMX On WheeIs’s LTA page for a third time, I noticed a banner at the top saying “Not to be confused with [[User:TheBuddy92/Willy on Wheels: A Case Study|Willy on Wheels]].” The link leads to a personal essay written by [[User:TheBuddy92|TheBuddy92]] about a vandal named “Willy on Wheels”. The essay characterizes Willy in a vivid manner, providing numerous examples of his naughty stunts (including but not limited to posting graphic images on highly visible templates, attempting to hide recent changes to stall the trailing administrators’ progress, and high-speed page move vandalism). There were also theories that he was a rogue admin. Curiously, there were no mentions of [[Asia]], [[fuerdai]], or cross-wiki vandalism. Did I miss something? Have I had been confusing the true identity of Wolly’s sockmaster all along? Yeah, it seems; it turns out that there have actually been two different abusive vandals and sockmasters who just happen to be similar in name and behavior! 

Willy and BMX started their careers over 13 years apart from each other (Aug. 2004 and Dec. 2017 respectively). As evidenced from old revisions of the WP:DENY page, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deny_recognition&oldid=45640054 this], Willy had been a very notable long-term abuser and a very famous part of wiki culture; several templates had even been created specifically to keep him in order. Eventually, virtually all of these templates (as well as his LTA page) were deprecated in lieu of the policy’s goals. It worked too well; I never had the slightest clue of Willy’s very existence, much less his former notability across the community, until recently. Given the evidence, it seems that BMX may very well have been attempting to impersonate Willy through the adoption of similar username patterns, similarly high patterns of LTA, and so on. What further complicates the situation is that BMX himself is impersonated by a third long-term abuser named Cruizir, who behaves more-or-less identically on the same level.

Ergo, Wolly on Whools might actually be Willy, not BMX as Kirbanzo and I were originally led to believe. It might seem like I’m being hypocritical by writing this and breaking [[WP:DENY]], but I think it’s very important that we set things straight and ensure that we don’t get confused like Kirbanzo and I when dealing with future instances of sockpuppetry and vandalism from either Willy or BMX. Contrary to older community discussions like [[Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Willy on Wheels 2|this one]], Willy still appears to be active, with the above essay even being vandalised on several occasions by him, rendering protection necessary. Or was that BMX? Or Cruizir? I have no idea, but I feel like those three disruptive editors should be straightened out once and for all, possibly using a CheckUser (or the CheckUser results should be publicly posted if they’re already there but private).

:Whilst the message on your talk page seems unnecessarily confrontational (in effect "I will revert anything you do")), and yes does read like a threat to hound you (especially as there seems to have been only 2 edits of yours he has undone, in the last two months). Without diffs as to what it was he reverted of yours it is hard to judge if it was valid (for example if you just insert the word "Twathammer" in every article).

::Unless I miss my guess, this has to do with the edit war the two are engaged over at the IP's talk page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:86.191.95.230&diff=prev&oldid=888276307], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:86.191.95.230&diff=prev&oldid=888275501].  While presumably the issues originated in mainspace, at some point the IP started removing the criticisms made against them by Chris at the talk page and Chris began reverting these removals; although he never states it expressly anywhere, Chris's rationale for these reverts seems to be that this is not an autoconfirmed user removing comments from their own personal talk page (which is of course permitted by policy), but rather these are messages left on a public IP user talk, which may over time be shared by numerous editors, and therefore should not be altered by any one person editing from that IP at a given time. This argument has clear merit, and while I am not sure if this principle is codified anywhere in policy, it certainly should be, and is the only logical way I can see the community ever treating this issue--and I'm sure it must have come up in some context before on this noticeboard.  

::All of that said, Chris isn't 100% in the right here either: there are a few comments in those exchanges that are just not acceptable, no matter the context or the level of frustration: no contributor or member of this community is empowered to tell another that they need to just leave the project, and it's not [[WP:AGF|our preferred method for dealing with even openly disruptive editors]], as an initial matter. The IP has very few edits total and we should be trying more constructive forms of engagement starting with more measured language.  To be perfectly fair to Chris, there's at least a couple of occasions where the IP has removed content without explanation in the edit summary and this may be where the vexation is coming from--it's also possible Chris is aware of other IPs/socks working toward common ends, so I don't want to judge too harshly without hearing his response first, but if there's not further such context, I'd urge that he could stand to ratchet back the needlessly confrontational/indeed threatening tone just a tad.

*So here's what happened: First, this IP from Britain has repeatedly inserted ({{diff|Harry Dexter White|prev|888156633|on 17 March}}, {{diff|Harry Dexter White|prev|889301775|on 24 March}}, and on {{diff|Harry Dexter White|prev|891110655|on 5 April}}) content about [[Harry Dexter White]]'s death. I reverted each time because no citation was added with the content. This is the sort of drive-by semi-automated editing I do anymore, since the angry crowd doesn't want me at XfD and other meta locations. It turns out it doesn't matter: the IP added content to the lede that was already sourced in the body. Despite my repeated corrections the IP didn't bother explaining their edits and we should have discussed why this should be in the lede. Second, as I reverted and issued the templated warning, I also added the IP talk-header template, since I don't know how many people are behind that IP. If issuing more than one warning I want to specify the warning isn't for everyone using [[BT Group]]. Further, sometimes geo-locating the IP will reveal outright conflict of interest and could point to socking. The IP involved repeatedly removed the talk-header which I reverted multiple times per [[WP:UP#CMT]]. I did this a bunch because I thought the talk-header couldn't be removed. [[User talk:Chris troutman#Your recent AN3 report|I had filed at EW but was informed that I was wrong]]. That was my mistake.

::{{re|Chris troutman}} The message still on the IP's Talk page is obnoxious.

Northamerica1000 is a strong portal advocate who persists at posting identical useless comments like this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AMiscellany_for_deletion%2FPortal%3AAndy_Gibb&type=revision&diff=890902470&oldid=890691602][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Portal:Adele&diff=prev&oldid=890902781] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Portal:Bedding&diff=prev&oldid=890902570] over and over at MfDs. Over the last few days NA1000 has done this with other canned comments. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Northamerica1000]. (Scroll through and see many identical or near identical sized posts to MfD) Is this ok or is inappropriate?  

NA1000 and her portal friends demand individual discussions and detailed unique deletion rational for pages that were mass created at rates of 5 or 6 pages a minute, sometimes over 100 pages a day, and yet several of these users are copy pasting canned votes ("meets [[WP:POG]]") is my favourite) and other comments in response to handcrafted deletion rationals.

*My comments in MfD discussions are not disruptive whatsoever, and are intended to provide factual accuracy, particularly for ''closers'' of the discussions. The op herein has used [[WP:X3]] as a qualifier for deletion in some MfD discussions, but WP:X3 is not a guideline or policy, it is presently a ''discussion''. As such, it is entirely equitable for closers and other potential MfD participants to be made aware of this matter in a neutral, impartial manner, as I have performed. Also, the closer of one MfD discussion may not be aware of my post in another discussion, hence the multiple comments.

*Legacypac, this is not the first time you've had it pointed out that referring to X3 as a reason for deletion before it has gained the consensus of the community is at best misleading and at worst deliberately disruptive. Even if it ''were'' currently accepted as policy It is unreasonable to assume that everybody who interacts with an MfD discussion will be familiar with all the jargon, so adding links and explanatory context is useful, not disruptive.

*'''Both sides are way out of line'''. It is very unhelpful that the nominator @[[User:Legacypac|Legacypac]] cited X3 when that is still a proposal under discussion.  I support adopting X3, but that hasn't happened yet, and it's wrong to proceed as if it has happened. Legavcypac should demonstrate good faith by promptly amending any MfD contributions which mention X3 without explaining that it remains a controversial proposal.
:I also note that the "keep" votes continue to resemble an attrition strategy. There is a crew of editors who splat-paste dubious keeps on scores of MFDs of  driveby-created portsalspam, even when the portals don't even meet the minimal criteria set by portal fans.  These same editors are doing nothing to assist in cleaning up the portalspam ... and while I cannot mindread and would like to believe that they are acting in good faith, it's hard to avoid noticing that their actions are wholly compatible with an attrition strategy of making it too time-consuming for other editors to clean up the flood of dross with the portals project sprayed out at high speed. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 14:05, 4 April 2019 (UTC)

Each discussion taking a week is not actually a problem anyway - and I don't know why you describe it as "glacial" as that's the standard length of time for all deletion discussions - it is intended to allow for all interested parties to become aware of the discussion, review the nomination and (if possible and they want to) improve the nominated page. The sheer number of similar nominations defeats that as it overwhelms the availability of editors.

And a smaller number (which still means a massive number) felt stuff like Portal:Science were useful. But it's clear some, like Legacypac, rejected even those. (I'm unclear whether Legacypac supported or oppose Current events and the Community portal. I assume they support keeping the Main Page, some people don't consider it a portal anyway.) But frankly as much as I like to nitpick, all except 2-15 vs all is a very minor point of difference. </p><p>Whether there's enough to refer to them as "those" I don't know, but my read of some previous discussions is it's probably not unreasonable. </p><p>Of course, the consensus was against ending all portals, and I'm in no way accusing those who supported, and still think we should just end them all, of failing to abiding by the community consensus. They may very well have done their best to abide by it, while still trying to cleanup and improve things in manners they reasonably feel are supported by the community consensus or to achieve consensus in areas where there's currently none. </p><p>It's perfectly reasonable for someone to have a certain view, but recognise the community consensus is against the view and to act accordingly. (For example, I still personally believe Main Page should be moved to Portal:Main Page or maybe Wikipedia:Main Page.) And the existence of a small number of people who do want to end all (or all except 2-15) portals in no ways means everyone advocating for changes and cleanup dislikes the existence of all portals. Clearly many support a number of portals. And as I've said before, there were major problems with the mass creation which is a big part of the reason we're now in a mess.

:::Even when the most blatantly useless portals (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Portal:University of Fort Hare|Univ of Fort Hare]]) are nominated, the portalspam defenders won't come along to support deletion of a portal-to-absolutely-nowhere.

When they are nominated in batches, you object that the batches are too big.  When a speedy criterion is proposed to save community time, you denounce that.  And you, Thryduulf, have repeatedly attacked anyone who supported any part of the cleanup.
:::In short, you are trying to maintain the flood of portalspam against the clear RFC community consensus that it was disruptive, and you are doing so by impeding every single path to cleanup, and offering no assistance even in the most blatant cases.

::::I can't speak for everyone of course, but I am certainly not trying to "impede every single path to cleanup". I'm simply doing my best to restrict cleanup to an appropriate pace that waits for consensus about what actually is cleanup, what needs cleaning up, what is and isn't a good portal and to limit deletions to those pages that actually need deleting rather than any other action. Some bundling is appropriate (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Portal:Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]] (6 clearly related portals of comparable scope and quality) and some is not (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Portal:Crabapples]], loosely related and of significantly differing scope and quality).

::::*(edit conflict) I've copy-pasted keeps on several MfDs and made it clear I was doing so, but I've also cleaned up several portals. There are over 100 ''nominations'' to remove portals as of several hours ago, when I last counted. Many of these nominations should be deleted, many of these nominations should not be deleted, but the overwhelming number of nominations makes it very difficult to review, the rules for what constitutes deletion remain flagrantly unclear, and many of these portals can be saved with a small amount of work. A copy-paste vote can be effective for reviewing a lot of articles in a short period of time. For instance, [[Portal:Tashkent]] was significantly improved since the nomination but is likely to be deleted based on the discussion. I also clearly see a problem, but it appears as if nominations like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion#Biography_portals]] has been effective so far in cleaning up a lot of the mess. I'd personally like to see a moratorium on nominations that weren't clearly bot created, or to at least have the flow reduced significantly, as this cleanup process has turned into a massive battleground and been one of the least pleasant experiences I've had on Wikipedia.

::::<p>Frankly I'm not particularly sure if this is a useful avenue of discussion in this thread but I have to say while it would be nice for those largely supportive of portals to comment in support of deletion in clear cut cases, I don't really see it matters much if they don't. </p><p>I mean I'm sure I'm not the only one who is often less likely to comment in some discussion if the outcome seems clear cut and my view is largely in concurrence with what's already been said. A bunch of pile-ons is often unnecessary and I assume particularly in the portal deletion discussion, based on the recent community consensus deletions normally happen even with only a few supports provided there's no opposition, rather than bothering to relist let alone make it a no consensus. </p><p>And of course, you should only comment if you've sufficiently examined the evidence to be able to offer a reasoned view. So I can understand those who are mostly supportive of portals not bothering with cases where they believe a deletion is justified but can't be bothered confirming just letting others comment. I mean sure, maybe they will save someone else's time when they see enough keep !votes that they don't bother. So in some ways it's a good demonstration of their commitment to cleaning up the problems that have been created. But ultimately it's hard for me to care about what happened in the Fort Hare example you cited since it looks like the right outcome happened without much fuss and no one actually !voted keep. </p><p>I'll be more concerned if there are no delete !votes in more borderline cases rather than clearcut ones. For example, with SportingFlyer's copy and pasted comments they've noted above, it seems to me sometimes the result of their analysis should be !delete so it's impossible to be right all the time from guesses beforehand. An exception may be if SportingFlyer only bothers to look into cases where there's a very high probability of it being keep. </p><p>[[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] ([[User talk:Nil Einne|talk]]) 17:37, 4 April 2019 (UTC)</p>

*'''comment''' For goodness sake. Why create pages that are subject to deletion if it is not manipulation of normal deletion process of 'content'? Is this an online war game in the minds of those engaged in portal creation. The appropriation of wikipedia for a mass of contributions—that draw in and isolate users from the process of legitimate content creation—is disruptive and creepy; fighting it out on talk pages is a sub-tribal response in an imagined territorial dispute. The objections to portals (and other cruft) a decade ago envisaged all this and I only see one winner, the champion of ''reuse of wikipedia within wikipedia'' according to their transcendent concepts of 'navigation'. This approach is a recipe for a disaster, granting several users the latitude to grant others the latitude for the liberal creation of pages: forget articles and join our club?

:::There's a continuum between ending all portals, and creating too many portals.

:::::That's a false equivalence though.  Just because two positions are in opposition doesn't mean the two positions are equivalent.  In this case, there is a clear spirit at Wikipedia that it is always the ''burden'' of the person wishing to create or keep something to establish that it is justified.  The default is "shouldn't be here".  Even without citing similar policies, that makes sense: Otherwise, people could just ''create things at near randomness and without any effort or thought'', and to demand that the position that ''those things shouldn't have been created'' is equivalent and requires an equal burden is silly.  There's a near infinite number of pages I can create at Wikipedia; the idea that ''not creating something'' is equivalent to ''creating it'' is simply not true.  The burden should ''always'' be upon the person who thinks that something ''needs to be at Wikipedia'', and the default should be "don't make it".  Our thresholds for burden are relatively low, but not zero, and especially in the case of non-content based navigation aids (where we aren't basing decisions on source text), it shouldn't be an equivalent burden upon those who say "we don't need this" It's the case of "proving a negative".  It should be the burden of a person asserting "this navigational aid is needed because..." to establish positive evidence that it is needed.  [[WP:BURDEN]] is about referencing content in actual articles, but in general greater burden should always exist for people who establish something as necessary rather than who simply hold that it is not.

::::::I agree it's a false equivalence, and I agree lots of these need to be deleted.

I think the first set should be fair game to be deleted as fast as they were created.  The second set, portals that had nothing to do with the recent mass creation, I could at least hear the argument that such nominations should proceed slower, because those older portals were probably created in good faith by an active Wikiproject that was, at one time, maintaining them.  Still, if the argument is that moribund or unmaintainable portals should be deleted, then if there aren't enough people to keep up with the deletion discussions, then how can those same people be able to maintain those portals?

:Conversely, I also appreciate that per the existence of [[WP:G13]], some potential nominations may not need to occur, something I have known for quite some time. Ultimately, if a moratorium for Draft namespace content being nominated at MfD is desired, this should be proposed and discussed at [[Wikipedia talk:Miscellany for deletion]]. It is my hope that Legacypac will consider abandoning their ongoing battleground stances and perform in a more civil, respectful manner toward others. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[[User:Northamerica1000|North America]]<sup>[[User talk:Northamerica1000|<span style="font-size: x-small;">1000</span>]]</sup></span> 12:59, 5 April 2019 (UTC)

::It is just weird that someone without much interest in draft space MfDs until now, suddenly nominates 13 drafts for MfD in one day (about one fifth of the number of drafts MfD saw per month from all editors together the last two months), for pages without in most cases glaring problems beyond what most rejected drafts have, and in at least one case actually defeating what draft space is for and why we have a 6 month delay between rejection and deletion ([[Draft:WEN ZHONGLIN 温忠麟]], a Chinese professor with lots of citations, was nominated for deletion just two weeks after rejection). Many other MfD nominations may be equally unwarranted or pointless (we have G13 to get automatically rid of them after 6 months anyway), but in most cases people didn't nominate this many at once, and when it includes drafts which should get a respite, not a sudden death because they are not acceptable in their current form (which we already know, that's "rejection"), then it becomes problematic. You still haven't really explained why it is important that these 13 get deleted ''now'' and not after their 6 months are over, seeing that they are not indexed and not linked to from the mainspace.

:::Deletion is a significant part of what I do. One could say it's weird that I have nominated many pages for speedy deletion at times in a succession, or several articles at AfD in a succession, but that's how I edit sometimes. With several users above stating that they have no concerns with my MfD contributions, it didn't cross my mind that nominating drafts would all of the sudden be perceived as problematic. Lately I've been finding content that qualifies for deletion using custom searches in user namespace, and simply performed this for content in draft namespace, because it crossed my mind to do so, to improve the encyclopedia. There's actually a lot of highly promotional, non-main namespace content all over Wikipedia that exists in a grey area regarding whether or not to tag for [[WP:G11]] speedy deletion or to initiate a wider community discussion. Sometimes, posting for wider community input is a proper, conservative approach to better determine, by consensus, whether or not content meets Wikipedia's guidelines and policies, an approach that also provides time for creators and contributors to respond to concerns. Regarding the Zhonglin Wen draft page, in its present form ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:WEN_ZHONGLIN_%E6%B8%A9%E5%BF%A0%E9%BA%9F&oldid=891060708 permanent link]) it qualifies for deletion per [[WP:NOTRESUME]], and arguably could have been tagged G11 which would have quite likely led to it being routinely deleted. Instead, I initiated a discussion. It is also important to keep in mind that Wikipedia is not a webhost for the publishing of [[WP:PROMO]] content for six full months, waiting for [[WP:G13]] deletion and leaving pages that violate [[WP:NOT]] indiscriminately in place. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[[User:Northamerica1000|North America]]<sup>[[User talk:Northamerica1000|<span style="font-size: x-small;">1000</span>]]</sup></span> 14:30, 5 April 2019 (UTC)

I've brought plenty of problematic drafts to MfD - stuff that needs deleting now or where the draft is being disruptively submitted usually. Occasionally an enthusiastic newer editor starts nominating random drafts and we explain G13 and CSD and they stop. NA1000 is an Admin who nominated [[Draft:List of Australian cheeses]] consisting of "Bfer cheese: cheese made of birb milk." which can only be seen as a [[WP:POINT]]y disruptive time wasting move. Taken in context of having an ANi open about their MfD participation, an MfD topic ban should be considered here. [[User:Legacypac|Legacypac]] ([[User talk:Legacypac|talk]]) 15:25, 5 April 2019 (UTC)
::{{tq|Taken in context of having an ANi open about their MfD participation}}... you conveniently neglected to much that it has been conclusively established by the participants in that ANi than NA1K had done nothing wrong.

:Several users above stated they have no concerns, so as I stated, it didn't cross my mind that nominating drafts would all of the sudden be perceived as problematic.

*Could someone explain why these MfDs are disruptive? I'm frankly don't see the problem. It seems like Legacypac is just looking for another reason to have a go at NA1K. I'll reconsider that interpretation if someone can explain why these nominations are a problem, but it isn't really helpful for Legacypac to expect the rest of us to connect the dots. And, given that this thread was completely frivolous when it began, I see no reason to conclude that this second complaint has any more merit than the first one.

**{{rto|Lepricavark}} I'll take the ball. <br/>1. Legacypac gets involved with a great many cleanup efforts (WP as a whole needs Janitors to clean up items that nobody really cares for). <br/>2. Legacypac got involved with the process of nominating portals created in a automated manner that may or may not have community consensus. <br/>3. Legacypac was using the argument that "proposed CSD X3 would cover this" on portal MFDs indicating that there could be a consensus argument that the portal was created by a specific editor with little quality control or useful scope. This may have been percieved as an end run around the consensus discussion about authorizing the CSD rationalle by showing that portals are frequently deleted with this being a contributing argument.<br/>4. NA1K is standing opposed to the deletion of these automated portals.<br/>5. Spontaneously NA1K moninated 13 pages from Draft space for MFD.<br/>5. Legacypac takes exception to this as there is the appearance that NA1K [[WP:POINT|disruptively]] nominated for deletion these drafts as one of Legacypac's interests in some sort of revenge/sorched earth strategy.<br/>6. Draft namespace is granted much more latitude than main namespace as these are "in progress" and potential future articles or ones where there is the belief that some level of normal editing can fix the cited issue.<br/>7. From my brief analysis, none of the drafts nominated by NA1K require the "immediate" deletion (copyright, attacks, negative BLP, etc.) and therefore the  [[WP:G13|CSD:G13]] {{tq|Any pages that have not been edited by a human in six months found in: Draft namespace, Userspace with an {{tlx|AFC submission}} template, Userspace with no content except the article wizard placeholder text.}} would clean thes up in 6 months if no editor provided even a single byte update.<br/>Hope this helps you connect the dots.

::::Thank you for explaining the reasons for objection to NA1K's actions. While I can understand why the MfD nominations might appear a little odd, and while it would probably be best if NA1K refrained from taking any more drafts to MfD for the time being, I must confess that I don't see how Legacypac will be personally harmed by the deletion of these declined drafts. I also don't agree with the assumptions made regarding NA1K's motives. In particular, the claim that she is opposed to the deletion of automated portals is untrue, as NA1K has demonstrated below. Legacypac is not accurately representing both sides of the portal dispute, so please don't take his word at face value. [[User:Lepricavark|Lepricavark]] ([[User talk:Lepricavark|talk]]) 15:46, 6 April 2019 (UTC)

:::'''No Shame'''. Well, most of the treatise above is just a bizarre personal conspiracy theory, with no basis in truth. I've already stated why I performed the nominations above, and that's why. There's no ulterior motive. 
:::For starters, the theory of my philosophy stated above about me as supposedly "standing opposed to the deletion of these automated portals" is just false. I have actually !voted for deletion for many of the portals nominated at MfD. Apparently you didn't bother to actually check, instead just stating some idea you made up. Furthermore, upon consideration of community concerns regarding portals, I nominated several that I created for [[WP:G7]] deletion, which resulted in their deletion. These are listed below:

It's a real time sink to have to spend my time responding to false accusations such as this here, having to state how I have !voted, etc. to correct these false claims. Stop casting aspersions.
:::Additionally, there are now several additional draft articles nominated at MfD (by other users) that occurred ''after'' my nominations, yet these have received no scrutiny herein. It's a real [[double standard]].

The nominations were not created to illustrate any sort of point. Please try to assume good faith. The ludicrous, beyond far-fetched theory directly above from Legacypac that nominations were performed in anticipation of others then using specific language, so I could then use specific replies to some sort of anticipated, crystal balled replies directed toward me after performing nominations, and all of this to make some sort of point, is absolutely ridiculous. I would never waste my time on such nonsense. I'm here to improve the encyclopedia. For example, in [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Draft:List of largest law firms by head count|this discussion]] I initiated concerns about potential [[WP:COPYVIO|copyright infringement]], which is certainly a serious matter that merits discussion.
{{paragraph break}}
The above is just more of the same ongoing, long-term pattern of negative ranting toward others by the user. Phrasing above such as "you stop with the cow manure", "childish", "throwing up stawmen" (sic), "experienced editors" (implying that I am inexperienced, which is untrue), and "ignorant behaviour" is intentionally performed in attempts to taunt and portray others in a negative manner, for whatever reasons, and possibly to [[WP:BAIT]] others in hopes to then obtain some sort of desired response. If one responds, the user seems to receive gratification from then having a reason to make more attacks. 
{{paragraph break}}
As such, it appears that the user has no intention of actually engaging in functional discussion with those they decide to dislike, because those with this mindset have nothing to gain by doing so. Instead, it appears that the user continues with the same pattern of casting [[WP:ASPERSIONS]], taunting, scolding and harassment because they seem to enjoy and are gratified by doing so. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[[User:Northamerica1000|North America]]<sup>[[User talk:Northamerica1000|<span style="font-size: x-small;">1000</span>]]</sup></span> 07:01, 7 April 2019 (UTC)

It's surprising that this user has gotten away with so much bullying. The initial thread above was a frivolous complaint. After this complaint was dismissed, it was followed by a subthread in which Legacypac employed mental gymnastics to try to find another way to portray NA1K as acting in bad faith. He then labelled NA1K's reasonable self-defense as "cow manure" and attempted to weaponize NA1K's admin status against them.

Not specifically an admin issue, but I'm stuck for ideas here.

[[Drug user]] is an old article that was linked to a DYK hook on the main page, before I edited it out of the hook. The article title itself is antiquated with old ideas of what is a drug and who is a drug user.  If you're taking any non-prescription medication you're taking drugs. Aspirin is a drug. The article was written in 2009 by someone who is no longer very active, and the scant history speaks for itself.  I consider it useless to post on the article talk page, as the stats (which is iffy today) say that talk page has had only one view in a long time. The article itself does not have many views. Tagging it won't do much. The article is embarrassing in its inaccuracies and outdated information.  Not all drugs are illegal, and some of most known celebrity drug deaths got their stash from their local doctors. The embedded list is just a random scatter-shot of famous names. With marijuana being legalized in more and more nations, the list is embarrassing. So ... can I put this up for deletion, and how would I classify it?

== Legacypac and portals ==

I am growing increasingly concerned that {{user|Legacypac}} is becoming obsessed with deleting portals to the point they may be trying to prevent users who might have opinions differing from theirs from finding out about their existence. As just the two most recent examples, they 
left a message on my talk page [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thryduulf&diff=889011424&oldid=888234467] suggesting that my listing MfD discussions on [[WP:DELSORT|deletion sorting lists]] was against policy, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal_talk:University_of_Texas_Rio_Grande_Valley&oldid=prev&diff=889010812&diffmode=source reverted] my tagging a portal nominated for deletion for relevant WikiProjects as "disruptive" - my goal with starting with those portals nominated for deletion is so that they appear in article alert lists so potentially interested editors get to see the portal and/or the deletion nomination (whatever their opinion of them). Note that I believe some but not all of the nominated portals should be deleted (and that some others should be merged), and I'm not restricting my tagging to portals I have one particular opinion about. My choice of projects to tag is those I see as the most relevant of those projects who tag the portal's main article (e.g. the Wisconsin and University projects for universities in that state). 

This is in addition to ad hominem comments - see as just one example the most recent against me at WT:CSD [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion&diff=888999939&oldid=888998858]. There are plenty of others on that page and in the majority of his MfD nominations (usually but not exclusively against [[user:The Transhumanist|The Transhumanist]], whether they were the creator of that portal or not). There are several examples of bad-faith and ad hominem arguments at [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Portal:Crabapples]].

::Discussion of portals is also pending at [[WP:AN]].  The particular comment for which Thryduulf provided the diff was a minor lapse in civility by Legacypac, who has been civil and has been focusing on content rather than on contributors.

How can a closimg Admin interpret a vote to merge [[Portal:The Ohio State University]] into [[Portal:Universities in Ohio]] or any page into a nonexistent page. I'm also curious to see a deletion sorting effort at MFD when I've never seen deletion sorting before there.

I did not refer to [[WP:RFC|RFC]]s because the RFCs are still running.  I see no deterioration of behavior.

===Admin OhanaUnited behavior===
I just closed [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Bottom Importance Portals]] as keep as Legacypac wished to keep the comments section open for full 7 days. Yet as soon as I closed it, Legacypac challenged my close result stating that it should be "withdrawn" and not "keep" because he withdrew it as nom (which defeats the original purpose of keeping the MfD discussion open after withdrawing) as well as considering me as "involved" because I'm a member of the Portal Project. Furthermore, he said he would pursue DRV just to overturn the decision from "keep" to "withdraw by nom." (Are we truly wasting editors' time on [[WP:WIKILAWYER|wikilawyering]]?) I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Legacypac&diff=prev&oldid=889200317 explained] my reasoning and his logical fallacy in his reasoning. Then he [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALegacypac&type=revision&diff=889200621&oldid=889200317 became hostile] and said he considers myself as involved because I signed up Portal newsletter and don't see me around at MfD...

===Deletion Sorting of MFDs===
I see no reason why [[WP:MFD|MFD]]s should not be deletion-sorted in order to publicize them more.  There are fewer MFDs than AFDs, and the volunteers are able to sort the AFDs, which helps to publicize them to volunteers who are interested.  It is true that MFDs have not been deletion-sorted in the past, and implementing deletion-sorting for them now should not be used to re-open any that have been closed or to slow down those that are active.  Maybe sorting should also be a way to publicize the creation of portals or proposals to create portals.

The creations were done in a race against time [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Transhumanist#About_that_end_of_the_year_goal...] so efforts to slow down the deletion of poorly conceived pages that the creator spent one or two minutes on are disingenuous.

Note that despite Thryduulf's repeated requests to "merge" some of these portals, there is absolutely ''nothing'' in these portals which even ''can'' be merged, as they are utterly devoid of any content, simply pulling text (at best, they also tend to pull things like long-deleted images and the like) from articles. They can be redirected of course, in the few cases where this may be warranted. As for The Transhumanist, they claim that no older portals can ever be deleted, as the consensus at the previous portals RfC was they should not be deleted en masse. It is hard to deal with such outlandish claims (and it isn't the first instance of TTH making unreasonable claims and demands to keep any and all portals) without getting exasperated. 

The community has spent countless hours debating these portals, which were created without any care or thought (as evidenced by the many utterly botched ones), and which now slowly get deleted one by one (or at best a few at a time) at MfD. All of this could have been avoided quite easily if the proposed speedy deletion had not been objected to on rather spurious or wikilawyering grounds, considering that absolutely ''nothing'' of real value is lost by deleting these. The few topics which could support a portal can have their portal recreated (with care and in a much better fashion), the speedy deletion is not a "verboten" on the portals themselves but a way (the best way by far) to deal with the mess created over the last few months by the TTH (and a few others to a much lesser degree), where TTH has gone to great lengths to defend portals, but has made little to no effort to actually check his creations and get rid of the most blatant problems, which are easily found when opening a few portals at random. Why anyone would defend these in good faith is completely unclear. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 11:08, 23 March 2019 (UTC)
:You say {{tq|1="spurious or wikilawyering grounds"}}, I prefer {{tq|1="civil obfuscation of the issues"}}, from earlier in the discussion, but that's semantics I guess. Anyway, the point is that anyone seeking to cause a huge amount of community time to be wasted on these pointless, embarrassing items, when little to no time or thought appears to have been invested in their creation is, either deliberately, or by missing the point entirely, advocating an extremely misguided course of action. --<span style="font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#004d80;"> [[User talk:Begoon|Begoon]]</span> 11:39, 23 March 2019 (UTC)

"your desire to delete good content along with bad" was claimed above. As these portals don't contain content, just code to republish content in an unsupervised way, there is ''no'' content deleted when any of these new portals is deleted. All that gets deleted is a rarely-viewed, automatically created ''presentation'' of existing content (related or unrelated to each other, the latter especially in the DYK sections), all content remains where it was.

::If by "aimer" you are referring to me, then I don't see a need to apologise for stating something which is true: You desire to see portals deleted without regard to quality. Portals contain content (that it is republished content is the whole point of portals). Some portals you wish to see deleted contain content that is bad and/or badly organised, some portals contain content that is good and/or well organised (and others contain content that is between the two, it's not black and white). Therefore what you desire is the deletion of both good and bad content.

Mostly this has been over the maintenance of lists of non notables. Persistent warring, reconfiguring article talk pages, and spurious accusations of vandalism.

{{user|217.92.132.253}} seems to be editing articles from a very particular (in part pro-Stalin) POV, and edit-warring with anyone who disagrees with their changes. I first noticed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rootless_cosmopolitan&type=revision&diff=891532224&oldid=891509757 these edits], which appeared to whitewash the antisemitism of Stalin's "rootless cosmopolitan" campaign, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rootless_cosmopolitan&type=revision&diff=891532027&oldid=891531160 this edit in particular], which, in my view, deceptively misrepresented and selectively quoted the author as saying exactly the opposite of what he says. I then noticed a pattern of similar editing in other articles; introduce a particular POV, then revert anyone who disagrees. I attempted to fix this in a couple of the other articles, but was reverted too, so I've brought the issue here.

*This is concerning. By my count, 14 of the IP's last 15 edits have ''Tag: Undo'', and several of them have ''Tag: Non-autoconfirmed user rapidly reverting edits''.

From what I can tell, these three edits are the ''only'' recent edits that ''don't'' involve a pro-Soviet POV, and came after this ANI thread was opened. The other two edits today ([[Special:Diff/891804137|diff]], [[Special:Diff/891804714|diff]]) revert Jay and Dolphin ([[WP:pointy]]), change the content to a more pro-Soviet POV, and are continuations of slow-motion edit-warring (clearly the editor is avoiding a 3RR violation but still edit warring). Same thing at [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]]. This is without even getting into the "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" issue laid out by Jay. For those that may not be aware of the general background, words like "cosmopolitan", "intellectual", and "bourgeois" were sometimes used as euphemisms for "Jewish" during anti-semitic purges, so it matters whether our article says that a purge was "anti-intellectual" or "anti-Jewish"–indeed, it's the subject of much media and historical writing over the last century, particularly "rootless cosmopolitan" (a euphemism for "a Jew with no nation", first said by Stalin in 1946, between the holocaust and Israeli statehood). This IP account strikes me as a pro-Soviet-POV [[WP:SPA|SPA]]. The "warning" on Dolphin's talk page post was basically a naked threat and shows a serious [[WP:battleground]] mentality, possibly rising to the level of harassment.

==‎Onel5969/Year in Radio links/Possible Script Misuse==
{{u|‎Onel5969}} has been removing (and edit-warring to remove) Year in Radio links (ie: [[1996 in Radio]]) which have been shortened to show just the year on 19 radio station pages.  Why 19, no idea.  First the user claims they are in violation of [[WP:DATELINK]].  When proven that there was an exception for these kinds of WikiLinks within DATELINK, the user once again reverted (I believe he is at 3RR, haven't issued the warning) and is now claiming something regarding [[WP:LINKING]].  If the user is going to remove the links from just 19 pages, he is going to have to do so from ALL radio ''and'' television station pages.

Plus, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Onel5969&diff=891165852&oldid=891160482 he claims] he is using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ohconfucius/script/MOSNUM_dates a script] to do these edits.  Clearly that script isn't working properly or has been changed.  I don't seen anything in the script where [[Year in Something]] is/can/will be changed.

I have tried to speak with ‎Onel5969 and gotten snarky comments and this claim of violation under one rule to a claim of a violation under another rule.  There has been consensus prior (BURDEN) that these are allowed and what harm are they really causing.  Plus, removing them on just 19 pages?!  So, I bring this to you all. - <small style="white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #FF7518;padding:1px;">[[User:Neutralhomer|<span style="color:#900;">Neutralhomer</span>]] • [[User talk:Neutralhomer|<span style="color:Black;">Talk</span>]] • 03:57 on April 6, 2019 (UTC)</small>

:I have respectfully requested Neutralhomer to provide examples supporting their position.  They have refused to do so. They have stated, "When proven that there was an exception for these kinds of WikiLinks within DATELINK", without actually have done so. When they reverted the edits I had made, which I did through the WP tool "All dates to mdy", I was a bit taken aback.  I remembered an instance which had occurred several years back where I had linked a year on a film article I had created to "xxxx in film", which had been reverted, but I couldn't remember the policy/guideline which had been cited in that revert. Since I couldn't remember, I posted a question in the Teahouse. Another editor (who I won't reference so that I won't be accused of CANVASSING), responded with the aforementioned [[WP:DATELINK]]. When I reverted their revert, and stated that position, they shortly reverted again, stating that as per [[WP:BURDEN]] it was up to me to prove my case. Now, that's not exactly what BURDEN is about.  That guideline has to do with removing and re-adding cited/uncited material, which has no bearing on this discussion. However in my looking at the basic [[WP:LINKING]] guidelines, I pointed out that one of the main points of creating a link was "Appropriate links provide instant pathways to locations within and outside the project that are likely to increase readers' understanding of the topic at hand." And then pointed out that to create a link to another page which didn't even mention the subject of the article in question hardly met that qualification. At that point, I made my second revert (which is what I always try to limit myself to), and made the point on my talk page I list above. Subsequent to that, I reached out to an admin I respect (again, unmentioned, as to not imply I am canvassing), to seek guidance on whether I should open a RFC on the topic. And if so, where. The issue, as I see it, is that the above editor feels that, as they put it, "Radio and TV station pages operate in a special "realm" in many rules and consensus discussions". And that very well may be true. But I went to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations]], and saw nothing which dealt with this topic. The only thing I saw was [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations#Infobox]] which states that instructions to the infobox can be found at the template, [[Template:Infobox radio station]]. At that location, the only guidance is that the startdate should follow this format: First date of broadcast, using <nowiki>{{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}}</nowiki>. This says nothing about linking to "xxxx in radio". I feel that bringing this to ANI at this stage is silly and a waste of editors' time, but since it has been brought here, I felt compelled to reply.

I've been asked to take a look at this thread, and my conclusions are the following:
# There is no consensus as to whether years in a radio station infobox should be linked to the appropriate 'x in radio' article (per advice given by Bearcat on Onel5969's talk page).
# Although Onel was getting towards the limit of 3RR two days ago, he does not appear to have edit warred since and has moved on, and sanctions are not punitive. If he begins systemic edit-warring across articles, ping me '''with diffs''' and I will look at it. (Ping me without diffs and I'll probably refer you to [[User:Ritchie333/Shut up and show them the diff|this]]).

*{{u|Ritchie333}}: I did try to discuss this on his talk page first to no avail.

::: Hi {{u|Ritchie333}}, I think the answer I gave to Neutralhomer's question regarding why '''these''' articles (emphasis mine), was "I attempt to make corrections on every article I touch. Whether it's filling in raw links, adding a short description, fixing dashes, harmonizing dates, stub sorting, occasionally de-orphaning, whatever. Those were articles that came up during my daily dab fix routine." I have no desire to seek out every radio article and delink those items, but the script clearly does delink them, in keeping with MOS guidelines. So is there a problem with the script?

:::: I recognise these scripts as I use them myself, generally running them manually after doing some improvement on an article.

{{user|Ziggy 2milli}} seems to not really be here to create an encyclopaedia so much as [[WP:UPE|get paid for pushing unacceptable puff pieces about celebrities]]. A fair number of his "articles" are horrendously-sourced, and have generally died to AfD, with many of them being moved from draft space specifically for Google exposure. More recently, AfD'd pages get moved to draft in an attempt to prevent their deletion should the AfD end as delete. A listing of articles he's created (based on his talk page) is:
*{{revisions|Marlo Hampton}} (G11'd)
*{{revisions|Doğukan Yüce}} ([[WP:Articles for deletion/Doğukan Yüce|AfD'd]]; he attempted to remove the AfD notice twice)
*{{revisions|Justin Klosky}} ([[WP:Articles for deletion/Justin Klosky|AfD'd]])
*{{revisions|Alex Quin}} ([[WP:Articles for deletion/Alex Quin|AfD'd]])
*{{revisions|Shyon Keoppel}} ([[WP:Articles for deletion/Shyon Keoppel|AfD'd]]; attempted to move to draftspace during AfD. Requested a restore at [[WP:REFUND#I need the page Shyon Keoppel to refund to draft|REFUND]] and, when asked point-blank about being paid, denied it unconvincingly)
*{{revisions|Luieville}} ([[WP:Articles for deletion/Luieville|AfD'd]]; moved directly from draft to main space by him; he attempted to move it back to draft to dodge the AfD)
*{{revisions|Luca Maggiora}} (Live at time of writing, sourcing is abysmal; he moved it from draft for Google exposure)
*{{revisions|Paul Fabritz}} (Live at time of writing, sourcing is abysmal; he moved it from draft for Google exposure)
*{{revisions|YNW Melly}} (Live at time of writing and now being worked on by others as he's achieved notability in the interim)

* Could be, but it doesn't geolocate to BKFIP's usual location.  I don't see a lot wrong with those edits, either, to be honest. [[User_talk:Black Kite|Black Kite (talk)]] 18:37, 9 April 2019 (UTC)
** Well, that is standard for BKFIP -- many of their edits are defensible on the merits.  In this case, the edit to Sylvester is not: some contributions really are fundamental and described as such in good sources, and some roles really are leadership roles and described as such in good sources.  Also, saying that "the school of [[utilitarianism]] [was] later mentioned by [[Jeremy Bentham]]" is obviously less accurate and meaningful than "the school of [[utilitarianism]] [was] later made famous by [[Jeremy Bentham]]".  Possibly third alternatives would be better in both cases. --[[User:Joel B. Lewis|JBL]] ([[User_talk:Joel_B._Lewis|talk]]) 19:15, 9 April 2019 (UTC)

This user is an SPA exclusively editing on [[Gab (social network)]] and the closely related [[Gab Dissenter]].

They demonstrate an impressive degree of rejecting consensus and community input, most notably in [[Talk:Gab_(social_network)/Archive_7#RfC_about_whether_Gab's_free_speech_policy_should_be_included_in_the_lede|this overwhelmingly rejected RfC]] they proposed for the replacement of well-sourced material for idiosyncratic, promotional interpretations completely unsupported by sources. In this RfC alone, they, per {{u|Softlavender}}{{diff2|879577135}}, managed to produce 80 talk page posts within 29 hours. Aside from talk page sealioning and bludgeoning, they [[User_talk:Ginjuice4445#Notice_that_you_are_now_subject_to_an_arbitration_enforcement_sanction|earned]] a month-long TBAN in January from {{u|Lord Roem}} for tendentious and disruptive editing, as well as continuing to edit war after being informed consensus on talk page. After [[User_talk:Ginjuice4445#Do_you_have_a_conflict_of_interest?|I asked them]] to clarify if they have undeclared paid editing on March 2, they disappeared for a whole month, until today, when they, in direct violation of [[Template:uw-paid1|uw-paid]], reverted a merger of the two articles {{diff2|891521599}}{{diff2|891522400}} in violation of the consensus achieved at [[Talk:Gab_(social_network)#Gab_Dissenter_merge|the merger RfC]] which they participated in, declaring in edit summary that {{tq|"No consensus for merge on talk page, AT ALL"}}. At this point I believe it is evident that this user is not here to improve the project, and only here to push a promotional POV in an extremely disruptive manner.

I really appreciate this, although your analyses left out the context of those old discussions and would not be to the extent of being relevant and helpful to this thread other than potentially falling into tu quoque category. I've sure made mistakes. Joined last June, This is my first attempt to make major contributions to an article that isn't some subcultural video games and I have not read or informed of relevant guidelines until I was waist deep in the discussions. The first diff you cited, I was responding to someone calling me personally responsible for the October 2018 synagogue massacre. While the other things you cited for battleground mentality and else, in the presence of now-sanctioned [[WP:CPUSH]] editors, and SPAs, it'd be admirable if you could remain totally calm throughout, for that would be a difficult endeavour. The RfC close you protested, it was on an RfC that was almost unanimously opposed where the subject of this thread made those 80 posts within 29 hours. For the COI concern you mentioned, I was unaware of the COI guideline nor did I consulted another editor prior to tipping Hayden. The content in question were never published anywhere and were not for once added to the article. The comment by I striked where you commented "apparently fictional" was indeed made by a block evader who was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?type=block&user=&page=User%3A50.107.64.0%2F19&wpdate=&tagfilter=&subtype= checkuser rangeblocked] by {{u|NinjaRobotPirate}}.

== Changing ethnicities to "Jewish" by IP range ==

Related previous filing in [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive1005#Disruptive_(NONAZIS?)_edits_by_185.113.97.195|in the archives]].

An IP editor from the [[Special:Contributions/185.113.0.0/16|185.113.0.0/16]] range continues to change ethnicities from "{{tq|FOOBAR}}" to "{{tq|[[Jew|Jewish]]}}". Most recent example is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sackler_family&diff=prev&oldid=889228140]. Past IP edit examples: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonah_Goldberg&diff=prev&oldid=888635499], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H%C3%A9di_Fried&diff=prev&oldid=884332395], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Goldblatt&diff=prev&oldid=883571126], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H%C3%A9di_Fried&diff=prev&oldid=881347348], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elliott_Abrams&diff=prev&oldid=881188057], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bari_Weiss&diff=prev&oldid=868593727], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jon_Favreau&diff=prev&oldid=862627895].

The motive behind these edits is unclear (anti-Semitic? Zionist?).

These edits from this range are sparse, so a range block would be inappropriate. I'm honestly not sure if there is anything that can be done (edit filter maybe?) but figured I should let admins know about it.

:Changing a person's ethnicity to "Jewish" has at times created a lot of negative feedback. There was an enormous to-do over indicating Bernie Sanders is Jewish back in 2016. But there are different reasons for this reluctance so I, for one, would have to know why the IP editor was insistent over changing this aspect of a bio. <span style="font-family:Papyrus; color:#800080;">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</span> <sup style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #006400;">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</sup> 00:04, 26 March 2019 (UTC)
::This is not a matter of "ethnicity" but rather changing what was previously a person's nationality or citizenship  to "Jewish" in the lead sentence of a BLP. This is inherently disruptive because it promotes the inference that Jews are not legitimate citizens of the countries where they live and hold legal citizenship. The comparison to the 2016 "Is Bernie Sanders Jewish?" controversy on Wikipedia is not valid. Not one single editor ever advocated that the lead sentence of his biography should be changed from describing him as an American politician to a Jewish politician. In brief, the issue was instead whether an ethnic Jew who is not religiously observant should be described as "Jewish" in the infobox, which implies religious affiliation. That was a far more nuanced and intelligent discussion and completely different from going to articles about Swedish citizens and American citizens, removing their citizenship, and calling them "Jewish" instead.

:I lack the technical familiarity to evaluate whether the test filter is working, but provided it only provides a list of edits for humans to scrutinize (rather than warning editors not to say "Jewish", of course!) then this is a rare case where an edit filter actually seems warranted.  This seems like a classic anti-Semitic focus (compare [[(((echo)))]]) and the distortion done to articles, including by the incidental removal of adjectives replaced, is significant.  Of course, Wikipedia articles should always welcome ''sourced'' information about persons' religion and ethnicity, properly added by human editors.

I think it's pretty clear the edits aren't intended in a positive way; this same editor is also interested in making it clear that Kurds are also not "real" Swedes (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurdo_Baksi&type=revision&diff=850140700&oldid=845211310 here]). [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Oshwah&diff=prev&oldid=767949170 This edit] clarifies why the editor makes these edits; it also shows that the editor edits from other IP ranges (in this case [[Special:Contributions/130.238.98.89]]), and that they've been at it for years, and seem unlikely to stop. If an edit filter can stop this, it seems like the best solution.

:I like the edit filter as a means to flag possible problematic edits, but not as a means to disallow or warn for such edits.  Users may legitimately be adding information on someone's Jewish religion or ethnicity to a lead sentence, for example a person who is a noted Jewish theologian or rabbi or something like that, and I'm not sure the edit filter could distinguish between such appropriate, good-faith edits and this sort of pointy flagging of Jewish people that our Swedish friend seems to be bent on doing.  If we flag the edits, and have a place that collects the flagged edits for review, we have something that helps real humans solve the problem.  --[[User:Jayron32|<span style="color:#009">Jayron</span>]][[User talk:Jayron32|<b style="color:#090">''32''</b>]] 15:04, 28 March 2019 (UTC)

:{{ping|Jayjg|Nil Einne}}, the filter is now improved at {{ef|982}}; the version at 953 was an initial version which was deliberately broad so that there aren't any false negatives.

== ClassicOnAStick - Persistent addition of unsourced content, refusal to engage ==
{{atop|result=Blocked x 3 months with the warning that the next one, if needed, will be indefinite. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 21:01, 12 April 2019 (UTC)}}
Hi all. I try not to be here if I can help it, but decided I'd rather not issue a unilateral indef in this case. {{U|ClassicOnAStick}} is a long-time gnome who focuses primarily on infobox maintenance, in the areas of video games, companies/organizations, and WWE. Their editing behaviors and refusal to respond to inquiries and warnings has already resulted in 4 blocks, including 3 escalating blocks by myself. Each of those blocks forced the user to acknowledge the issue on their talk page, with a promise not to continue. They seemed to essentially accept the block, did not try to appeal, waited it out then returned to editing. As a result, what I've basically seen is they stopped editing video games and companies (thus dodging the editors who were warning them from those areas), and are now focusing on WWE alone. Since the last block, their talk page has at least 10 individual warnings or notes from other editors about edits that were reverted, why (I.e. MOS, unsourced, etc), all without any response from the user.

{{u|STATicVapor}} gave them some warnings in March about unsourced edits, which I noticed via watchlist. I left a personal message to Classic asking them to engage, hoping to avoid being in this position, but they did not respond. Static contacted me again that Classic is continuing this, including some apparent unsourced BLP edits.

Since the last block was for a month, I feel the next step is probably an indef, as there is little indication the editor will change their behaviors. But I want to make sure that's where we need to go. -- [[User:Ferret|ferret]] ([[User_talk:Ferret|talk]]) 11:54, 12 April 2019 (UTC)

* This editor has been around a while, since I used to edit WWE - certainly long enough to learn. However, is the next step after a month an indef? Could we do a year first?

**To me the main difference between an indef and year in this situation is that the editor can come back in a year, with no appeal, and restart as they did before, eventually landing here again. With the indef, after six months they can attempt an appeal with standard offer. The indef requires them to appeal and engage the community. The lack of engagement is nearly (or more so) an issue than the problematic edits themselves. -- [[User:Ferret|ferret]] ([[User_talk:Ferret|talk]]) 13:14, 12 April 2019 (UTC)

These edits may seem minor, but they are very disruptive to the project as people have to consistently revert them in order to maintain accurate and truthful material.

:The issues pointed out in the first ANI have clearly continued, and are definitely disruptive to the project. The user's continued inability to cite sources with their edits, as well as communicate and respond to messages and concerns regarding these issues, are not acceptable. Given the number of discussions that have been opened about this, and the number of messages and changes that have been given to the user to respond and work to improve their edits that have gone ignored - it's clear that this issue will only continue unless administrative action is taken in order to prevent additional problems. Given what I've seen and found in this (and the previous) ANI discussion, I've blocked [[User:Es204L|Es204L]] for two weeks. This will hopefully put the appropriate brakes on this user, and be what's needed to nudge him/her to improve their edits and communicate. If not, a longer block can easily be applied in the future if necessary.

== Bankster - unilateral moves and RM reverts ==

Last month, I discovered and RMed a series of articles moved unilaterally by [[User:Bankster]] without discussion. (The RM is at [[Talk:Sistema Público de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano]].) However, within 36 hours of the RM closing and articles being moved, Bankster reverted six page titles back to how he had them before, again without discussion. The pages are currently at [[Channel 9 (Argentina)]], [[Channel 1 (Colombia)]], [[Sandinist Television System]], [[Channel 13 (Argentina)]], [[National Radio Television of Colombia]], and [[Workers' General Confederation of Peru]]. What should be done in this situation? [[User:Raymie|Raymie]] ([[User talk:Raymie|t]] • [[Special:Contributions/Raymie|c]]) 04:04, 11 April 2019 (UTC)
:[[User:Raymie|Raymie]], have you talked to this user directly regarding their reversion of the page moves and the moving of the articles back to the old titles? What did he/she say in response? [[User:Oshwah|<b><span style="color:#C00000">~Oshwah~</span></b>]]<sup><small><b>[[User_talk:Oshwah|<span style="color:blue">(talk)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Oshwah|<span style="color:green">(contribs)</span>]]</b></small></sup>  04:06, 11 April 2019 (UTC)
::{{ping|Oshwah}} I have. When the original move that got my attention occurred a month ago, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bankster&diff=887207540&oldid=883969679 left a message on his talk page]. He [[User_talk:Raymie#Re:Mexican_State_Public_Broadcasting_System|replied on mine]]. Bankster did not participate in the resulting RM, though he did leave a comment on another case where I had other substantive concerns with the article title at [[Talk:Digital terrestrial television in the United States]]. I think it's worth noting that this incident echoes the original issue that has pervaded his conduct, which is lack of discussion/consultation with other editors. This was an issue that recurred several times on his talk, and it is unfortunate to see that it is recurring again with reverting the results of a recently concluded RM. [[User:Raymie|Raymie]] ([[User talk:Raymie|t]] • [[Special:Contributions/Raymie|c]]) 04:12, 11 April 2019 (UTC)
:::[[User:Raymie|Raymie]] - Thank you for responding with the additional information and details; that was very helpful. Given that each article you listed here was moved following a [[WP:RM|requested move]], then moved back to the original title unilaterally by [[User:Bankster|Bankster]] without a request or discussion first - I've reverted the page moves that he/she performed and moved each article back to the title that followed a requested move, and left Bankster a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bankster&diff=891943049&oldid=891939682 notice] on his/her user talk page asking him/her to stop making unilateral page move reversions without a discussion or consensus first.

:::Woshiyiweizhongguoren is obviously collaborating with [[User:Jingiby|Jingiby]] to push Bulgarian views on Balkan articles, all I'm doing is cleaning out the obvious agenda pushing in these articles as my history indicates.

Clearly a breach of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view | WK:NPOV], and Woshiyiweizhongguoren is supporting him in this act and is sending threats to me to discontinue my editing. Jingiby has a highly negative reputation, as can be seen by googling his name. All I'm trying to do is make articles which he has edited have more neutral perspectives. I can give examples of Jinbigy's edits which are obvious breaches of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view | WK:NPOV] that I neutralised.

== User: MantaWon editing Brandon Wade page to remove factual information ==

{{user|MantaWon}}

I've noticed a persistent campaign on [[Brandon Wade]]'s page to remove references to his birth name, Lead Wey.

They are almost always done by new accounts, the most recent being MantaWon.

In the latest round, a deceptive edit was made by Dutchboy2885 here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandon_Wade&diff=prev&oldid=869466740] under the description "Added NYT reference", when in reality it was accompanied by an unexplained removal of references to Lead Wey.

When I reverted it, MantaWon reverted it back. Note that there is a pattern of new users that only edit Brandon Wade's page to remove his birth name, including Aussiebear99[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandon_Wade&diff=prev&oldid=854659320], Jazzman987[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandon_Wade&diff=prev&oldid=842972724], SpanishBird00[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandon_Wade&diff=prev&oldid=842023706], and Gemface212[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brandon_Wade&diff=prev&oldid=821974523].

== Twinkle abuse by Shervin27 ==

{{user|Shervin27}} added information to the [[Ayanda Patosi]] article, which I reverted, citing WikiProject consensus and a recent RFC (linked on the article talk page-- which he has not commented on). He has continued to revert me using Twinkle, which is a clear case of [[WP:TWINKLEABUSE]] - [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ayanda_Patosi&type=revision&diff=892288920&oldid=892282138, 1], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ayanda_Patosi&diff=next&oldid=892289424 2], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ayanda_Patosi&diff=next&oldid=892290566 3] (especially #2 as they have used Twinkle to revert good-faith edits without using an edit summary).

== [[User:PPP001]] mass creating uncited stubs ==

First, my apologies if this is malformed, but I try to stay away from ANI, so can't remember if this is the first time I've ever begun a discussion. Regardless, this new user has been mass creating stub articles regarding political subdivisions in <strike>India</strike> Malaysia. From the beginning, they were creating these stubs without proper sourcing, as you can see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jalong_%28state_constituency%29&type=revision&diff=887881102&oldid=887868349 here], but back then they responded by adding a valid source, as you can see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jalong_(state_constituency)&diff=prev&oldid=888162257 here]. Shortly after that, they were asked to format their references, rather than simply adding raw links, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APPP001&type=revision&diff=888172534&oldid=887905438 this]. And they responded to that request positively.  However, the very next day, they began to create stubs without valid references, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nilai_%28state_constituency%29&type=revision&diff=888325098&oldid=888311449 see here], and again when informed, they began to make corrections. Recently, beginning April 10, they started to mass create these stubs, and were using an invalid reference (see [[Bebar (state constituency)]] as an example). They were informed numerous times about this issue, see [[User talk:PPP001]] and [[Wikipedia talk:New pages patrol/Reviewers#Large number of constituency stubs by PPP001]]. However this time they are not responding, and are simply recreating these unsourced stubs. This is taking up the time of a number of editors.  I feel a short, temporary block might be needed to get this editor to slow down and simply provide valid sourcing for their articles. I would have waited longer after {{u|Elmidae}} posted a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APPP001&type=revision&diff=891869334&oldid=891868654 specific comment on their talk page], but they are still ignoring the messages and have begun a new recent spurt of these article creations, like [[Tioman (state constituency)]].[[User:onel5969|'''<span style="color:#536895;">Onel</span><span style="color:#ffb300;">5969</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:Onel5969|<i style="color:blue">TT me</i>]]</sup> 11:59, 11 April 2019 (UTC)

{{Userlinks|Bonzofreak}}

Bonzofreak is an [[:WP:SPA]] who has been editing [[:Jonathan Mover]] or content related to Mover in spurts since the account was created back in 2007. Despite being repeatedly having edits undone and asked to discuss things on the article's talk page, Bonzofreak has may no effort to follow [[:WP:DR]] and engage in any discussion; in fact, I cannot find any record of Bonzofreak making any posts on any article talk pages or user talk pages at all since the account was created. There have been warnings added to their user talk page [[:Special:diff/Rodericksilly/809118526|here]] and [[:Special:diff/Rodericksilly/875931961|here]] by {{u|Rodericksilly}}, [[:Special:diff/Binksternet/891563937|here]] by {{u|Binksternet}} and [[:Special:diff/Marchjuly/891807738|here]] by myself, but there's been no response from Bonzofreak other than to keep trying to force their preferred version of the article through ([[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/877614939|1]], [[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/877763003|2]], [[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/890376109|3]], [[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/891514332|4]], [[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/891599046|5]], [[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/891757227|6]], [[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/891759424|7]], [[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/891800843|8]] and [[:Special:diff/Bonzofreak/892228789|9]]) without leaving even an [[:WP:ES|edit summary]] trying to at least explain why they are reverting or adding unsourced and promotional content. Concerns were raised about a possible COI at [[:WP:COIN#Jonathan Mover]] and Bonzofreak was notified of them [[:Special:diff/Binksternet/891788432|here]], but there's still been no response.{{pb}}Being an SPA is not a problem in and of itself, but being an SPA who refuses to engage other editors in any manner and try to follow [[:WP:DR]] eventually becomes [[:WP:DR|disruptive]] and [[:WP:NOTHERE]] type of behavior, especially when it's been going on as long as this. There has to be at least a willingness to discuss things with others to try and resolve content disputes, and the COI concerns, etc. aren't going to go away as long as Bonzofreak continues to remain silent.{{pb}} Since this editor basically edits in spurts, I'm not sure how much value a short block would have other than as a sort of final warning not to keep repeating the same behavior; so, perhaps an administrator could make one last attempt to encourage Bonzofreak to start following WP:DR and collaborate with others in improving the article in accordance with relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines or face a fairly long or indefinite block if they don't. -- [[User:Marchjuly|Marchjuly]] ([[User talk:Marchjuly|talk]]) 05:38, 13 April 2019 (UTC)
:Bonzofreak emailed me today, raising his concern that "someone is vandalizing the wikipedia page for Jonathan Mover" and asking me if I could help him figure out what is going on.

{{atop|It seems pretty clear that there a consensus against this proposal.  [[User:GoldenRing|GoldenRing]] ([[User talk:GoldenRing|talk]]) 14:32, 15 April 2019 (UTC)}}

Look at [[‎#Northamerica1000 disruption at MfD]] and [[#Legacypac and portals]] on this page, [[WP:AN#Thousands of portals]], the hundred or so  portal nominations currently at MfD, [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case#Portal issues]] (which is heading towards being declined) various other discussions linked in those threads and it is clear that something needs to done to stop this getting even further out of hand. I suggest that community discretionary sanctions for all discussions about portals (including but not limited to MfD) is a simple and necessary first step. Specific restrictions on specific editors can then be placed as needed with much less drama than at present.

'''''Note to everybody''''' please keep this discussion on topic. It is not the place to discuss the merits or otherwise of portals, the merits or otherwise of portal MfDs, portal speedy deletion, portal prods, etc, etc. It is also not the place to discuss specific incidents and/or specific users (use existing sections or start new ones for this), it is intended ''solely'' for discussion about discretionary sanctions for the topic area.

*'''Oppose, at this point at least''' - there are a fair few negative discussions, but I don't think there's been sufficient attempt made to handle the disruptive conversations using the regular means (I suspect the prevalence of experienced editors has discouraged stricter de-escalation beyond conversation (which is a great first step, but clearly not enough at this point)). Until standard conduct review methods such as ANI have been shown, to a clear and convincing level, to not work then I don't feel we should escalate to DS - which are frequently overused and an absolute nightmare to ever get rid of. With regards to breadth, it's a relatively small group of editors throughout, rather than this absolutely hoard of disruptive editors that require a shoot first, review later policy.

*'''Support for 45 days''' (or other similar range of between 30 and 90 days). The purpose of GS/DS is to empower administrators to take actions to benefit the encyclopedia which might otherwise be difficult to impossible to do. As someone who doesn't see much value behind Portals but also has a "hey I'm already weird because I edit wikipedia and even among these weirdos I'm weird because of my [[WP:YA|niche]]" live and let-live attitude I'd welcome a chance for community discussions to play-out and consensus to form. It seemed, at least from my casual observations, that things had cooled a little when the ARC was filed but as it has become clearer that this would be declined (which I think is the right thing for ArbCOM to have done) it seems that the temperature is heating back up. It further seems from the threads I've observed at ARC, AN, and ANI (as well as the occasional talk page) that it's the same players going at each other time and time again. A timelimited GS would hopefully allow some neutral administrators the leeway to help cool the temperature back down so there is space for editors who care about Wikipedia but cannot muster the passion of a thousand burning suns around Portals and/or their deletions to (re)join in and help guide us to a conclusion but also then not continue to stick around forever. Because after we (hopefully) reach a point where consensus has been reached, there will be alignment about the way forward even if there's not complete agreement.

*'''Oppose''' without any indication what kind of discretionary sanctions the proposer has in mind in which situations. Would ''too many'' nominations be sanctionable?

*:{{u|Fram}} I'm clearly on a fairly small island with Thryduulf in seeing benefit for this so let me give a go at answering your questions: the problem that GS would try to tackle is general disruption to the project caused by editors who are fighting, as EEng says, the Portal Crusades. So for one disruptive editor the answer might be a limit on MfD nominations per week. For another it might be that they may not initate/comment at ANI about portals related behavior. For a third it might be a more typical behavior warning. Essentially it's appropriate sanctions ala [[User:Awilley/Discretionary sanctions]]. The goal should be to decrease the temperature and allow the project to come up to alignment for a way forward with Portals.

*::{{u|Barkeep49}}, I have read and re-read the discussions at both AN and ANI, and from what I've gleaned, {{u|Northamerica1000|NA1K}} has done nothing wrong; certainly not anything even remotely considered unbecoming of an admin. She is indeed a creator of portals - many of which represent excellent work - and has also demonstrated -0- opposition to the deletion/nomination of any portal that fails to meet inclusion criteria; therefore, not a steadfast inclusionist or deletionist as what we've seen in the infobox wars. With regards to behavior, I have never known NA1K to be either impolite or refuse/deny any editor an opportunity to openly discuss an issue in the proper venue. What I've gleaned about {{u|Legacypac}} is that he appears to be focused on the clean-up and deletion of portals, a large number of which resulted from a brief episode of mass creation that has since been addressed. Quite frankly, the evidence/argument he has presented against NA1K simply doesn't support his steadfast position. Based on my experiences, it seems out of character for Legacypac, and it saddens me that 2 highly productive editors are at odds over issues that can be easily resolved with a bit of productive collaboration at the proper venues. I remain cautiously optimistic that Legacypac will step back long enough to realize what a mental strain and absolute time sink this entire incident has been, and will turn his focus to other areas of the project where his contributions are much needed and appreciated, such as AfC/NPP. It's time to let others handle the portal situation for a while.

*'''Good God no'''. Never in the history of Wikipedia have discretionary sanctions "decreased the temperature"; they just increase the toxicity of already-toxic issues by forcing disputes to fester because people are afraid to comment. If an editor is being disruptive then treat them as we would any other disruptive editor. To hammer home a point that hasn't been hammered enough here, this is {{em|not an important issue}} since 99.99% of readers never see a portal; yes, malformed portals are a nuisance and need to be culled and yes, the mass creation constituted intentional disruption, but hardly anyone will ever see the malformed portals and I'd like to think nobody would be stupid enough to try to restart the mass creation.&nbsp;&#8209;&nbsp;[[User:Iridescent|Iridescent]] 20:03, 5 April 2019 (UTC)

*Something needs to be done indeed. There are many people here saying that discretionary sanctions are nor required because the usual processes are sufficient.

* '''Doing ''something'' at random has no chances''' to improve anything. Only doing some right things could do that. First point that needs ''some right thing''. The [[Portal:Dangun]] is a just created 2,857 bytes page. But it's deletion will not delete 2,857 bytes of information. To create this marvelous portal from scratch, only the 14 bytes incantation: {{tl|subst:bpsp}} were needed. Therefore deleting the <math>3000+</math> content-less portals will not delete <math>\approx 3000\times 3000 </math> bytes of information, but exactly nothing (<math>=0</math> bytes of ''information''). What to do with the repetitive clamors about ''don't kill our precious <math>10,000,000</math> bytes'' ?  Second point that needs ''some right thing''. Many SPP=Single Purpose Portals seem very similar in their intents to these SPA=Single Purpose Accounts that are chased across the wiki. I don't think we have to try to provide a commercial advantage to KFC versus McDonalds or conversely. For the present, these portals score 448 versus 199 views '''per month''' (probably most of them from the deletion discussions): rather ridiculous than COI...  but big holes start by small ones.

*'''Oppose''' - I have struck my support above because I have re-thought the issue.  On the one hand, discretionary sanctions could be imposed on the portal platoon of editors who are recklessly creating portals that are broken and need deleting.  However, the community has shown that it is capable of dealing with reckless portal creation without DS.  On the other hand, in portal deletion discussions, the point has been made that discretionary sanctions are never imposed on administrators.  The current conflict over portal deletion involves disruptive activity by an administrator supporting the creation and retention of portals, [[User:Thryduulf]], and one non-administrator, [[User:Legacypac]], who is nominating portals for deletion and expanding MFD nominations in a way that confuses and gums up the debate.  Discretionary sanctions would, in practice, only be applied to one non-administrator who is trying in a sloppy and frantic manner to clean up the portal mess.

****It's not a matter of "using DS against" people - it's not a battlefield (no matter how much us vs them language some people employ), and even if this proposal had been successful it would not be me implementing them. Discretionary sanctions would be there for uninvolved administrators to deploy as they see fit, that might be removing or restricting one or more users from one or more discussions (which could equally be me as anyone else it was felt I was the one being disruptive), but equally it might be more general - limiting the number of concurrent discussions for example.

*I should note that Enigma virtually ''never'' notifies users he blocks, which is something that is required by blocking policy. Looking into his other logs, I'm already seeing bizarre behavior in other areas too. For example, he indefinitely extended confirmed protected the redirect [[Audrey Geisel]], which was being vandalized. ECP, much less indef ECP, did not appear to be necessary.  When you examine the deleted contributions, you can see that there was no disruption from autoconfirmed accounts, and the period that the redirect was subject to vandalism was fairly brief. But, in conjunction with his indef ECP, he bizarrely deleted the page and then selectively restored only the non-disruptive edits. Therefore, no one other than admins can see the evidence as to why the page was locked. Cleaning up an edit history seems fine, but when that edit history pertains directly to an admin action, it's unacceptable. I don't have time to keep digging right now, but I doubt this is the last inappropriate behavior I'll be able to find.

**Comment, since this is the second time it's been mentioned.

***If a policy says you "should" do something, that does not suggest that it is optional. Nothing about the word "[[wikt:should|should]]" implies "optional recommendation". It is, by definition, an obligation, or a duty, the opposite of an "optional recommendation". "Should generally" or "should usually" would imply that exceptions can be made, but even ''if'' you extremely stretch your interpretation to that extent, we're not dealing with exceptions. Even if it's merely "general guidance" in which exceptions can be made (a dubious suggestion to begin with, but I'm humoring you), that still does not give one license to engage in an extended pattern of ignoring policy guidance.

****That is a very interesting linguistic opinion based on literally just half of the first definition given for that word.

:::::::Since there is confusion, let's clarify: if you've been adminning for any length of time, it is clear from context (i.e. how the policy is applied) is that should is used in the "it's highly recommended, though clearly there would be exceptions" realm, RATHER than the "you must do this under penalty of death" realm.  To wit: for most "garden variety" blocks (i.e. standard vandalism, edit warring, gross misconduct and abuse, etc.) we always notify, or must try to.  ''However'', there are also clearly times when notification is not necessary, usually when blocking a long banned user who jumps IP addresses rapidly.  In those cases, there comes a point when leaving notice is just silly, and we [[WP:RBI]] and move on.  So yes, we leave notice (and I will note that every block by Enigmaman so presented above seems to be those types that mandate rather than suggest a block notice), HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't times when leaving a notice is not only unnecessary, but probably counterproductive.

* And, generally, I am not a fan of crowds with pitchforks. I did not look at all the details, though diffs which I checked indeed look problematic. However, as a complement to problematic diffs, I would like to see evidence that the problems have been pointed to / discussed with the administrator, and they did not (or, actually, did) correct their behavior. This might be or might not be the case here, but generally for most administrators one can find diffs of some actions they were not really proud of.

:::I also agree with [[User:Paul August|Paul August]] here. There are many things to take into an account when looking into cases such as this. As stated by [[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]]: Whether or not the user (in general, not referring specifically to Enigmaman) has been given the chance (or ''how many'' chances and opportunities were given) to improve their edits and behavior following feedback and notices left asking them to stop is something that certainly can be examined and taken into account by the community (if they choose to do so). Another aspect: Whether or not the user, given the feedback or notices left about issues or problems with their edits or actions in the past, have honored such feedback and actually ''ceased'' such issues or behaviors and stopped them from happening again. However, as [[User:Paul August|Paul August]] and many others have pointed out here: judging the issues as a whole will be a balance between these different viewpoints. Whether or not the user was asked to stop the behavior before, and how the user has responded to feedback in the past and worked to put an end to issues - are aspects that can only be considered up to a point depending on the issues and problems. If the issues are eggregious, severe, neglegent, or abusive enough (again, I'm speaking in general and not specifically referring to Enigmaman) - these aspects begin to lose their importance, relevance, and their consideration by the community... :-) [[User:Oshwah|<b><span style="color:#C00000">~Oshwah~</span></b>]]<sup><small><b>[[User_talk:Oshwah|<span style="color:blue">(talk)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Oshwah|<span style="color:green">(contribs)</span>]]</b></small></sup>  15:42, 11 April 2019 (UTC)
:::: Yes, I think we are in full agreement here (again, I did not really look into the case and did not try to find the diffs). For example, it is pretty clear that if an admin vandalized a page and reverted the vandalism revert (or made sure vandalism was not accidental) they must be desysopped, and no feedback is needed. And there is the whole range between this and blocking someone for 48 hours rather than following the usual practice of 24 hours.

That said, I have always felt that in really clear situations a motion of "No Confidence" by the community ''should'' have the effect of prodding a wayward admin to do the right thing.

*'''Oppose''' The arbcom request is likely to be accepted and even if the committee bounces it back to the community, we should take our time in systematically gathering the evidence, and evaluating it and Enigmaman's response, before deciding on appropriate action. The diffs provided so far are certainly concerning IMO but there is no emergency here. Over the next few weeks, Enigmaman's edits and esp. any admin actions they (inadvisedly) choose to take are sure to be closely scrutinized and any indication of them going rogue will be met with a swift block. Barring that we all can step back and let the process play out. I recommend closing this ANI report for now; interested editors can instead help by gathering evidence (off-wiki or in their userspace) relevant to the case for presentation at the arbcom case or at [[WP:AN]], depending upon where the case finally lands.

*'''Oppose''' - This is not a reasonable proposal. ArbCom is intended to be the venue of last resort for disputes, not blatant admin abuse. Per [[WP:ADMIN#Arbitration Committee review]], ArbCom may step in at any point if they feel an admin-related issue is serious enough. Based on the [[WP:RFAR]], Arbcom is obviously going to accept the case, which means that this sort of "failsafe" is not necessary. In the event that Enigma is brazen enough to abuse the tools going forward, which I don't think is a realistic scenario, Arbcom can and would simply perform an emergency desysop pending formal desysopping. This AN/I thread is, at this point, an unnecessary and fairly-meaningless fork of a pending ArbCom case, and it should be closed so as to not distract from the actual case.

*'''Oppose''' both on procedural grounds and on the merits. This is an attempt at forcing a community-desysop process through the back door. We don't have a community desysop process, because all such processes that have been suggested over the years have been rejected, and if we ever were to install one, it very certainly wouldn't look anything like this here. On the merits of the case: I see one weird (and as yet unexplained) block from the other day that was clearly bizarre and suggests a profound momentary failure of judgment, but didn't do any factual harm. I see another arguably bad block that was a year ago and wasn't followed up on. Apart from that, I see trivialities like occasionally swearing at vandals, which definitely don't warrant a desysoping, plus several accusations being bandied about that are evidently factually false. Let Arbcom look at the situation if they think there's more than meets the eye, but handling it via mob-with-pitchforks is not the way to go.

*::::Well, call it a TBAN, editing restriction or what have you. Perhaps choosing to call it a TBAN is unnecessarily distracting. Either way it would be a community sanction restricting on-wiki actions according to the disruption present in the particular circumstances. The community can and has enacted tailored sanctions of all sorts, and if we can reach a consensus to enact revert restrictions, restrictions from using rollback, huggle, from XfD, from XfA, and everything else under the sun (including at least one community restriction on "special signatures"), then I don't see a policy based reason to think that's limited by anything other than consensus. It wouldn't be a community desysop, and the person subject to it would not require an RfA to overturn, but merely the consensus of uninvolved editors.

*'''Oppose''' - this is not the right venue.

That is the effect of the proposal as written. The admin in question should be under no doubt that their every move will be scrutinised by some editors, and is advised to be extremely cautious in the use of the tools in the meantime. But a TBAN is not the answer. Let ARBCOM do the job they are there to do. [[User:Mjroots|Mjroots]] ([[User talk:Mjroots|talk]]) 09:56, 15 April 2019 (UTC)

*Pile-on '''oppose'''; this is a blatant attempt to slip a "guilty until proven innocent" process in via the back door. Regardless of whether you like it or not, Wikipedia's longstanding process is that Arbcom makes decisions about desysopping; there are good reasons for that policy and this thread is evidence of one of the primary ones, that angry mobs on drama boards are prone to knee-jerk overreactions whereas the glacial pace of Arb cases allows calm examination of whether something is actually a serious problem or just a momentary blip.

== [[Mahmoud Reza Khavari]] and [[Sam Mizrahi]] ==

There has been coordinated efforts to remove any connection between wanted Iranian Canadian banker [[Mahmoud Reza Khavari]] and [[Sam Mizrahi]]. In 2016 [[the globe and mail]]<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/the-toronto-developer-the-iranian-fugitive-and-the-bitter-condo-feud/article30833853/</ref> and [[Financial Post]] <ref>https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/an-iranian-fugitive-toronto-property-mogul-and-a-deal-gone-awry</ref>reported that Iranian Canadian banker who fled to Canada has invested in properties owned by Mizrahi developments and there has been legal dispute about financial issues between the two parties. Since this issue is a sensitive political issue and involves issues regarding middle east, there has been coordinated disruptive behavior to remove this connection probably by people associated with Mizrahi developments. The page has been edited to remove the sourced information from the globe and mail by [[User:Shemtovca]] multiple times over the past two years, each time removing information that was published by globe and mail, most of the time with a cover up of [[WP:ATP]] or [[WP:NPOV]] where in fact the goal was and is to remove this information from public eyes. The user El_C blocked me for trying to prevent removal of this sensitive information from this page. My edits were neutral and only presented the information that was published in the article that are from a now closed case that is public. <span class="plainlinks">[//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Reza_Khavari&diff=891595011&oldid=891116905 first edit]</span> * <span class="plainlinks">[//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Reza_Khavari&diff=891621205&oldid=891608989 second edit]</span> * <span class="plainlinks">[//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Reza_Khavari&diff=891867149&oldid=891860336 third edit]</span>
I don't think users such as [[User:El_C]] who are misusing their adminstrator access should have access to block, and anybody who is neutral to middle east issues would see what is going on here.

:This looks like a content dispute, which should be resolved via some form of [[WP:Dispute resolution]] as with all content disputes. ANI is never the place to resolve content disputes. Note that the basic part of any dispute resolution entails all parties engaging in discussion in good faith not accusing others of being in a gang [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_Reza_Khavari&diff=892053556&oldid=892039703] or part of a coordinated campaign. Actually such claims when made without evidence are likely to be seen as a [[WP:NPA|personal attack]] and liable for a block. Instead the discussion should focus on whether the proposed change comply with wikipedia policy and guidelines including [[WP:BLP]], [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:ATP]] and why they improve the article. Such discussions would therefore including consideration of how much coverage, if any, to give of [[WP:non-notable]] people, including relatives of the subjects of articles, in light of said policies. If even after engaging in discussion in good faith you cannot come to [[WP:Consensus]] on the way forward, the aforementioned [[WP:Dispute resolution]] page outlines possible paths forward.

My main problem with these edits is that no one seems to address why the information from a well respected journal should not be included about the subject matter, If you believe the source is not reliable present your evidence, if you think that there WP:NPOV issues present your evidence, but the other parties in this dispute just remove a clearly written well sourced piece of neutral information about the subject matter without presenting any factual evidence why, the fact is in cases like this usually the party that removes factual information gets punished not the other way around. In addition many pages involving issues related to middle east conflicts, between Israel and Palestinians and or Israel and others have been subject to intense propaganda wars by all sides in the past. My issue with [[user:El_C]] is that there was no warning to the other user about why he insists on removing factual information, and also there seems to be some sort of friendship between the two users as [[user:Shemtovca]] is able to call [[user:El_C]] to block by writing on User_talk:El_C's talk page. That is why I believe this page should be reviewed by a neutral party who is impartial to the middle east and be locked in that state until a consensus is reached among all parties involved.

:There's nothing more to discuss here. As I said above, you need to engage in discussion in good faith to resolve any content dispute. If you really can't reach consensus there are several ways you can get help. I've already suggested BLPN but there are many others. As I said before, ANI is never the way to resolve content disputes. But in any case, your first step should probably be to go back to the talk page and engage in proper discussion rather than continually making ill-founded accusations of bias. Note that you suggestion of locking the article is simply not how things work on wikipedia, so is further evidence you don't really understand how things work here.

: When news publishes something about someone it is added to their Wikipedia page, and it was not done only by me, but a couple of editors and the page included that information for more than two years. It is only recently that this information is suddenly removed without any explanation why, which also coincides with petition from Iranian Canadian Congress to investigate Khavari last month. However I still have not figured out why a criminal banker from supposedly antisemitic Israel hating Islamic Republic is loved so much by people who put star of David or pictures of Lenin in their profile. One would think naturally that it should be the other way around. Its OK, I won't edit this page again, but no amount of censorship can prevent an idea that its time has come. Good luck.

Yeah, you did block him, so it's not like you're ''encouraging'' this kind of behaviour, but it seems like this pattern of finding new ways to get around the TBAN is just going to continue indefinitely, and resetting to one week with what amounts to "you found a new way to violate your TBAN without ''technically'' violating it" sets a dangerous precedent in cases like this.

It seems to me that [[User:Light show]] either doesn't understand what they're doing wrong or what a indefinite topic ban actually is, or they '''do''' understand but are trying to find ways to indulge in their particular obsessions. Note this in their initial request above: ''The last time I asked an editor to check on an edit to a bio I got slammed for proxy editing and '''had my sentence extended'''.'' [emphasis added]. Since it's an indefinite topic ban, "extending" it is not physically possible.

This is the same claim they made the last time they were blocked, two weeks after yet another denied appeal: ''I forgot. Since there was no actual rationale '''for extending the ban another six months''' ''[emphasis added]'' due to my request, other than two editors' asking that I first display an act of contrition, I guess it didn't register. --Light show (talk) 01:18, 18 August 2018 (UTC)'' --[[User:Calton|Calton]] &#124; [[User talk:Calton|Talk]] 23:52, 14 April 2019 (UTC)
:Indefinite bans (usually) have a 6-month moratorium on appeals.  That is, a user may only request a lifting of the ban once every 6 months.  Each such request resets the clock on requesting an appeal, as do any violations of the ban; thus a user may not request an appeal of their ban for a minimum of 6 months after any of the following 1) the ban is placed 2) they appeal their ban or 3) '''they violate their ban'''.  It is item #3 whose clock is reset for LightShow.  Every time they violate their ban, the clock is reset on their ability to appeal.  This is generally true for many, if not most, indefinite bans.  --[[User:Jayron32|<span style="color:#009">Jayron</span>]][[User talk:Jayron32|<b style="color:#090">''32''</b>]] 13:39, 15 April 2019 (UTC)
:I am well aware of that. And he wasn't talking about appeals, he was talking about the bans themselves -- or are you saying that there's some way to "extend" an indefinite ban? Maybe "infinity plus one year", or something? --[[User:Calton|Calton]] &#124; [[User talk:Calton|Talk]] 15:13, 15 April 2019 (UTC)
::"Indefinite" isn't a synonym of "infinite". In this case, what LS is talking about is that the "indefinite period" is "at least six months", and he's complaining about the six-month clock being reset. If you want a real-world analogy, consider a criminal serving a life sentence who's been set a minimum term after which he'll be eligible to apply for parole, and is disputing that eligibility date.&nbsp;&#8209;&nbsp;[[User:Iridescent|Iridescent]] 15:17, 15 April 2019 (UTC)

What does the community do when a user, namely [[User:LE|LE]], declares that he or she does not intend to abide by the basic policies of Wikipedia, namely [[WP:NOR]]?

*LE on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_British_monarchy_records&diff=892250923&oldid=892226690 13 April], in reference to [[User:Agricolae|Agricolae]]'s explanation that reaching original conclusions through scholarship is prohibited by [[WP:SYNT]]: "Which is a clear example of the policies Wikipedia needs to abolish!"
*LE on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_British_monarchy_records&diff=892500056&oldid=892462461 14 April]: "Original research should be highly praised and sought after as nothing else gives any article independent value.The powers that want to make Wikipedia a pile of vomit that does nothing but regurgitate what can (and therefore should) be found elsewhere get far too much respect!"
*LE on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_British_monarchy_records&diff=892583878&oldid=892502091 15 April], in response to [[User:Agricolae|Agricolae]]'s explanation that [[WP:NOR]] is one of the core policies of Wikipedia: "And I trust I left no ambiguity as to my contempt for that attitude. Textbook example of 'a custom more honoured in the breach than the observance.' Praise complaint, not compliance; eschew deference, demand defiance. But on a self-published site that regards other self-published sites being self-published sites as something wrong with them, I realize the herd mentality is strong."

And while we are at it, I would also like to throw in some name-calling that most people outgrow in primary school. When he or she came up with the term Surtsickness in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Flyte35&diff=prev&oldid=876246613 January], I assumed it was just a pathetic way to express annoyance with me by twisting my name. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_British_monarchy_records&diff=892596454&oldid=892587427 Today], however, it has been made clear that Surtsickness is meant to be my diagnosis, "the ''idee fixe'' that Wikipedia needs less of what it actually needs more of; also, irrational attachment to misguided policies that can be twisted to achieve this end."

The very least we should do, in my opinion, is thoroughly investigate this user's contribution, especially those pertaining to [[WP:BLP|biographies of living people]]. [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 19:30, 15 April 2019 (UTC)

::::{{ec}} Maybe. De-escalation is preferable in most circumstances, but it can be counterproductive; when someone has a repeated history of doing something wrong and all that ever comes of it is some variant on "please don't do that again", the signal that gets sent is "you can do whatever you like because you're too important to lose", and so the problem just carries on.

I don't want to set up a site ban proposal until I'm sure it's good a good chance of passing, as I don't particularly fancy being the new Number 1 person on Tony's shit list (which I inevitably would be if I did that).

::::::I'd be inclined to see if the shock of the block has an effect before we start talking about site bans. Per my comment above, I strongly suspect a lot of Tony1's problematic conduct is because he's become so used to nobody standing up to his bullying and harassment that he genuinely feels it's acceptable; a clear and unambiguous "if you want to stay here you need to follow our rules from now on" will hopefully be enough. Don't get me wrong, I do think we'll ultimately end up at the site ban stage—[[User talk:Iridescent/Archive 27#Long reply|as I said to you once before]], Tony1 is one of the most arrogant and aggressive people I've ever encountered on Wikipedia—but he deserves the chance to try.&nbsp;&#8209;&nbsp;[[User:Iridescent|Iridescent]] 16:53, 17 April 2019 (UTC)
:::::::I agree it's worth trying that.

And yes, "one of the most arrogant and aggressive people I've ever encountered on Wikipedia" is a succinct and accurate description. As an aside, while reading (in some cases re-reading) those historical examples, I tried hard to find an example of Tony1 ever softening his stance, backing off from attacks, accepting the possibility that another opinion might have some validity, giving anyone else any leeway, or showing even a hint of compromise. I could not find a single example, just escalating aggression every time from an apparent "Tony1 is infallible" position.

*If the notification alert I got was my invitation to chime in to this discussion, I will do so. I have to confess both a not-terribly-high level of familiarity with Wikipedia policy as opposed to Wikivoyage, and a complete ignorance of the nature of Tony1's contributions to Wikipedia before now. But even given said unfamiliarity, common sense prevents me from imagining any lucid argument in favor of ''not'', at long last, instituting a block on Tony1 for his reprehensible conduct.

**Also: [[User:Iridescent|Iridescent]], I hold out little hope that it's a matter of him being "so used to nobody standing up to his bullying and harassment that he genuinely feels it's acceptable". At Wikivoyage, we identified and stood up to his problematic conduct from the getgo, and long story short, we got nowhere with that tactic despite continuing to give him the benefit of the doubt for far longer than we probably should have.

:Four things. Can't you help to fix it? Have you tried communicating with this editor other than with templates on their talk page? Have you reverted any of the unsourced content?

Asking someone, ''"can't you help to fix it?"'' isn't very logical in this situation. [[User:Hell in a Bucket|Hell in a Bucket]] isn't asking for sections and content to be blindly removed or articles to be deleted because they have miscellaneous issues or problems in random areas, or similar requests where asking, ''"can't you help to fix it?"'' would be more understandable... he/she is reporting a user for repeatedly making problematic edits and violating policy despite ''numerous warnings and notices'' left on their user talk page that have clearly gone ignored. There comes a time where just "cleaning up" and "leaving warnings" stops becoming the right thing to do, and reporting the repeated issues and the disruption becomes the logical and ''effective'' thing to do. :-) [[User:Oshwah|<b><span style="color:#C00000">~Oshwah~</span></b>]]<sup><small><b>[[User_talk:Oshwah|<span style="color:blue">(talk)</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Oshwah|<span style="color:green">(contribs)</span>]]</b></small></sup>  13:44, 18 April 2019 (UTC)

I also hope that the user takes the time to understand the need to read the notices and warnings that other editors leave for him/her on their user talk page.

{{user|Drama panchi}} is a relatively new editor who mostly edits articles about Indian television shows, movies and actors/actresses.  He's also uploading images for several of those articles and that's the immediate issue here.

More than a few of the articles they have created have been [[Draft:Aghori (TV series)|moved to draft space]] and others have been [[Rajaa Betaa|deleted]] or [[wp:Articles for deletion/Bhavika Sharma|being considered]].  One article they [[Ek Thi Rani Ek Tha Raavan|recreated]]  so many times after it was moved to draft space that it had to be protected.  They then [[Ek Thi Rani Ek Tha Ravan|changed the spelling]] to get around the protection.  Multiple notes about that article were left on their talk page about working on the draft version with no response or change in behavior.  There's a useful editor somewhere here, but right now it's not really visible.  I've got concerns about there general [[WP:CIR|ability to work with Wikipedia policies]] and ability to communicate.  An outside review would be helpful here and ideally, an acknowledgement from Drama panchi that they will stop uploading images and only create in draft space until they become more familiar with Wikipedia's policies.

I redirected [[Atony|this]] unsourced medical article to wiktionary (after searching for more references and only finding either medical dictionary entries, or information about the specific conditions), and was reverted by [[User:Dw122339]]. No big deal, maybe it should be a set index instead? He used no edit summary when reverting me, so I asked him about this on his talk page, and rather than responding, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dw122339&diff=892926369&oldid=892926325 he deleted it].

Looking at the history of his talk page, he seems to do this any time someone leaves him a message, so I'm unable to communicate with him.

== Blocking [[User:Reckon Her]] from Editing [[Belfield FM]] Article or Locking the Article from Unapproved Editing ==

To whom it may concern,

My name is William McCartney, I was previously the station manager of Belfield FM, the entity which the article in question details. The current station manager has been voicing her concerns over user "Reckon Her"s (a volunteer at the station) contributions to the article.

While the users contributions have largely fleshed out information on the stations, there have been many instances of unnessicary editorialisation over the history of his edits. Recently I removed some slanderous information about oxygen.ie/the SMEDIA Awards in the relevant section on the page to avoid any potential conflict between their party and the station. There was similarly a minor bit of inappropriate editting with "Keepin' it Country" redirecting to an article on peasant revolts.

The current manager notably expresses distaste towards the controversies section. While detailing the full history of the station is important, this section, as the largest in the entire artilce, has gotten a little out of hand, with some paragraphs lacking citations and essentially being an act of megalomania. Men's Rights Radio is his own show, and there has never been any concerns raised over its naming. While I hold a personal stake in the information about myself, its largely just here say; he messaged me after making that message asking what I thought about that with my real name being included, which seemed a little spiteful.

As a small society with in our university, allowing someone like this to wedge their personal feelings into a encyclopedia entry can have a negative affect on the university's percetion of the station which could lead to a loss of funding and the eventual closure of the station. I urge the administartive team at Wikipedia to review this incident and consider introducing heavier restrictions on the artilce.

Please do let me know if you need any further information or verification.

Yours ever,

William  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Nibbihak|Nibbihak]] ([[User talk:Nibbihak#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nibbihak|contribs]]) 12:37, 16 April 2019 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

[[User:Reckon Her|Reckon Her]] ([[User talk:Reckon Her|talk]]) 14:59, 16 April 2019 (UTC) I am the user in question, sorry I'm new to wikipedia but the station is very relevant to the media of University College Dublin and prior to my editing of the article it was in a poor state which didn't really give the correct information or really any comprehensive detail about the station. I am the Technical Officer of the station and as such thought it would be prudent to put some time into fleshing out the article to give a good idea of the impact of the station and it's relevance to University College Dublin in general. If there's a conflict of interest however I will refrain from editing any further.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Reckon Her|Reckon Her]] ([[User talk:Reckon Her#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Reckon Her|contribs]]) 14:58, 16 April 2019 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
         *{{reply to|User:Black Kite}} Due to the station existing within a college media space, there is a lack of records available about it online. Myself, Reckon Her, and a few others have mainly used paper records within the station to flesh out the article. [[User:Nibbhak|Nibbiak]] ([[User talk:Nibbihak|talk]])

Hello, Reckon Her (And Nibbihak!) -- I have no doubt the station is very relevant to UCD (lovely place, by the way) and notable to everyone there.  However, on wikipedia, we judge notability from reliable (preferably secondary) [[WP:RS|sources]].  Thus, citations to the station itself or to University materials don't hold a lot of water here.  I've done just a very quick search, and I am afraid I am not seeing a lot out there in news or the like--but there's every chance it's out there and I'm missing it.  If you could find some sources like those, it would be a big help to the article and the community.  Thank you for your efforts. [[User:Dumuzid|Dumuzid]] ([[User talk:Dumuzid|talk]]) 15:04, 16 April 2019 (UTC)

Thanks for your input Dumuzid! Could you provide any insight into what sort of sources would be best to support the article or if there's any way one could reformat it to better reflects its notability? [[User:Nibbihak|Nibbihak]] ([[User talk:Nibbi|talk]]) 15:16, 16 April 2019 (UTC)
* Hi - you need multiple ''secondary'' sources - i.e. ones that aren't associated with the college or the radio station.  Newspaper or other media articles are good, as are articles on websites.  They should be focused on the subject, though - not just mentioning the station in passing. For more detail, have a look at [[WP:GNG]]. [[User_talk:Black Kite|Black Kite (talk)]] 15:19, 16 April 2019 (UTC)

15:24, 16 April 2019 (UTC)[[User:Reckon Her|Reckon Her]] ([[User talk:Reckon Her|talk]])as a point of other secondary sources which have mentioned bfm. The controversy around "Keepin it Country" was widely reported on at the time. https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/team-ucd-radio-show-keepin-15520757 https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/keeping-it-country-agriculture-students-sorry-for-lewd-remarks-on-ucd-radio-show-37603219.html https://www.spin1038.com/news-and-sport/ucd-students-apologise-disrespectful-comments-made-college-radio-234260 https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/ucd-students-apologise-for-alleged-sexual-comments-about-students-on-radio-show-890520.html https://www.herald.ie/news/college-radio-show-sorry-for-sexual-comments-about-female-students-in-unacceptable-broadcast-37602916.html
Would this be the direction we should take with the article? I could flesh out this specific controversy and search for other outside sources.

Reckon Her and I have settled this issue in our own litigation. If anyone has any additional input on the page then I suggest continuing on the relevant [[Talk:Belfield FM|talk page]] [[User:Nibbihak|Nibbihak]] ([[User talk:Nibbi|talk]]) 16:04, 16 April 2019 (UTC)

::{{ping|Nibbihak|Reckon Her}} I've [[WP:DELETION|nominated the article for deletion]]. Your sources, whilst they mention the "Keepin It Country" in great detail, only mention the radio station in question in passing, which fails [[WP:NOTABLE]] and [[WP:42]]. And according to ''The Golden Rule'' (other name for WP:42), the meaning of notability is: "Articles generally require significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the topic."

* {{userlinks|Likeit2004}}
Likeit2004 has competency issues that have not been resolved after two blocks and a heap of warnings on his talk page. These competency issues, and some attitude problems, have already resulted in two blocks in March and just recently. Here is what I wrote at [[WP:AIV]] for those:
* {{vandal|Likeit2004}} &ndash; On [[Family Guy (season 17)]] ({{diff|Family Guy (season 17)|888074961|888070792|diff}}): vandalism after final warning. Persistent disruptive editing. Multiple copyright issues listed on talk page - Continues to upload images without FURs, arbitrarily replaces existing, entirely appropriate non-free images with others. In one case he replaced one appropriately named image with a duplicate that he had uploaded with a "worse" name (I warned him about this 11 days ago but he repeated his actions - and just [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Simpsons_%28season_29%29&type=revision&diff=888076272&oldid=888074278 did it again]!), makes multiple arbitrary colour changes in articles and does not communicate.
::Copyright issues persist to this day. Still uploading images without FURs. Still giving images bad names. Still not communicating.
* {{vandal|Likeit2004}} &ndash; On [[:File:Barrescuevol12.jpg]]: vandalism after final warning. Editor persistently uploading images without required licensing and/or non-free use rationale in violation of [[WP:NFCC]]. I'm sick of warning this one and trying to fix his messes. I gave him a final warning yesterday,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALikeit2004&type=revision&diff=890854973&oldid=890854483] but it's been ignored.
::Still uploading images without licensing.
His competency issues are not limited to one area, he covers everything. Some recent, i.e. last 24 hours, issues:
* [[:File:Ellens1.jpg]] and [[:File:Ellens2.jpg]] and uploaded without FUR or license.
* [[:File:Dance-momsseason8.png]] uploaded without FUR or license. File:Dance-momsseason8.png didn't have an article to be used in. Instead he added it to [[Draft:Dance Moms (season 8)]] which he moved to article space 3 hours later. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Dance_Moms_(season_8)&oldid=892922762 The version] that he moved was clearly not ready for article space and was moved back. Likeit2004 is well aware that articles need to be sourced.
* Still (sadly) on Dance Moms, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Dance_Moms_episodes&type=revision&diff=892896769&oldid=890914314 here] he transcluded the non-existent season 8 article to the List of episode pages. This is a typical issue, where he does everything out of order, adding content to pages when the content does not exist and won't exist for hours, days or never.
* Creating multiple, or alternate pages for the same subject. For example, {{noredirect|List of Ellen's Game of Games}} was created and then abandoned a minute later. Six minutes later he created [[List of Ellen's Game of Games episodes]] as its replacement but made no attempt to redirect the abandoned article. Similarly, [[El Circo de PR]] was created and then moved to [[Draft:El Circo de PR]] 7 minutes later and abandoned for [[El Circo de La Mega]] which has existed since 2008. Likeit2004 now seems to think that draft space is a repository for dead and abandoned articles.
* Creating articles that are incomplete and clearly not ready for article space. In a similar fashion to uploading files without required information he created [[Ahora Con Oscar Haza]] which I is assume is a TV program but consists of nothing more than an unsourced infobox.
* Even though I warned him about uploading files without required licensing etc only a few hours earlier,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALikeit2004&type=revision&diff=892923119&oldid=892922826] he uploaded [[:File:El-circo-logo.png]] and [[:File:Elcirecodelamegatv.jpg]] less than 3 hours later with no license. Strangely, he was able to upload [[:File:Baylnmegatv.jpg]] half an hour earlier with the required information. It's almost as if he only adds the required information when he wants to. Other images, such as [[:File:Familyguyseason16dvd.jpg]] and others linked in red on his talk page are never fixed.
* Created {{noredirect|I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say D'oh}} as just an unsourced [[WP:PLOT|plot summary]].[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I%27m_Just_a_Girl_Who_Can%27t_Say_D%27oh&oldid=892944600] Note the link to a totally different episode at imdb although you do have to give him credit for including {{tl|copy edit}} and {{tl|more citations needed}}.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I%27m_Just_a_Girl_Who_Can%27t_Say_D%27oh&diff=prev&oldid=892944416]
These examples are just from the last day. Other examples are persistent recreation of articles such as {{noredirect|The Simpsons (season 31)}}. He has recreated this article five times now.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Simpsons_%28season_31%29&type=revision&diff=886223196&oldid=886222641][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Simpsons_%28season_31%29&type=revision&diff=886952387&oldid=886223513][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Simpsons_%28season_31%29&type=revision&diff=887603049&oldid=886952387][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Simpsons_%28season_31%29&type=revision&diff=890442165&oldid=890150683][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Simpsons_%28season_31%29&type=revision&diff=892193842&oldid=891920447] On only two occasions has he added a source. Such articles are contrary to [[MOS:TV]]. The consensus is that season articles require substantial content or at least a sourced episode table for their creation. MOS:TV says that mere renewal notifications should be in the lede of the List of episodes page. The source that Likeit2004 added was exactly that. I have warned him about articles being created prematurely[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALikeit2004&type=revision&diff=890454633&oldid=890454195] but, like other warnings, this has fallen on deaf ears.
I had to ask him to name files more appropriately after he uploaded a number in the format "File:Barrescuevoxx.jpg". The "volxx" part of the name means nothing, it doesn't correspond to actual season numbers and some have changed the article on which they were used so I assume he's just uploading the images and assigning them randomly, which is inappropriate and contrary to [[WP:NFCC]] in that the files are only being used for decoration. Most did not include FURs or licenses and some have been deleted for that reason. The naming issue continues and, while it is not a huge issue, it demonstrates that this editor is unwilling or unable to comply with simple requests. I'm sick of trying to fix his mistakes, especially when he makes the same ones over and over again. I really don't think he is competent to edit Wikipedia. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:#008751;">Aussie</span><span style="color:#fcd116;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 07:55, 18 April 2019 (UTC)

{{userlinks|Thefearmakers}} has persistently added unsourced material, OR, and personal commentary to various film- and music-related articles for over two years. Despite reverts and several warnings on their talk page, they continue to do so unabated. Some more recent examples:

They have been editing since December 2016, advised of the applicable policies, received multiple reverts and warnings (including of a possible block), so there isn't an excuse. A quick review of their edits shows that they are of the same personal commentary/OR/unsourced type, usually trivial, and in an unencyclopedic style.  An extended block may be necessary to break them of the habit. —[[User:Ojorojo|Ojorojo]] ([[User talk:Ojorojo|talk]]) 17:07, 20 April 2019 (UTC)

<!--PLEASE CAN WE GIVE THIS UNTIL 10:30, 3 APRIL BEFORE CLOSING?-->
{{vandal|Moylesy98}} has just come off a block for edit warring and has resumed hostilities. Short of an indefinite block, I think that the only way this can be dealt with is by means of an editing restriction:-

"Moylsey98 is permanently prohibited from adding an image to, removing an image from, or changing any image contained in, any article or list." 

He may propose additions, removal or changes at talk pages. Any additions, removals or changes may be made by any editor of good standing if there is consensus for same.

* And ''5 minutes'' later they're indef blocked? C'mon give the guy a chance to at least reply!
: I would support this indef block (rather than a TBAN) because it's fundamentally behavioural and failing to see what the rules (do source, do follow consensus, don't edit-war) are, rather than narrow enough to filter. Maybe they can make some case for "OK, I get it, I'll stop" and we could at least ''try'' that. But surely they get time to respond, at the very least?

:: Seriously, I don't see the point.  They've been blocked four times ''this year alone'' for doing exactly the same thing over and over again, and they clearly haven't understood ''why'' they've been blocked.  The latest block was for two weeks, and they came back straight away with reverts of the exact same material that got them blocked for edit warring (i.e. replacing good images with their own sub-par ones), with edit-summaries like "''Reinstatement following removal by a spammer''" and "''Deliberate removal of image owing to jealousy''".  We can only have limited patience with this, I'm afraid. If they come back with an unblock request that addresses the problems, then yes we can try a limited unblock, but they need to understand why they keep being blocked first, and they clearly haven't.

::::* They've just posted an unblock request which is going to be rejected on sight: it's a reasonable case for what they believe to justofy their editing, but it's entirely not an unblock request, as it doesn't address the reason for blocking. As such, yet another blocked editor is just going to have their unblock request refused summarily, leading to yet another angry ex-editor.
::::: Their "request" ''still'' fails to address the underlying problem, and is a complete misunderstanding of how image selection for articles is, or should be, done.

::::::Meh, I have difficulty seeing any of this as a real failing on our part. Lots of people have tried to talk to Moylsey98 long before it came to this. I see plenty of non templated comments on their talk page, including from you. Moylsey98 has barely responded (even from looking at their contrib history). They've shown zero real willingless to learn and seriously engage with people to try and understand where they're going wrong. It's not like they've come back and done things slightly differently each time. They've generally just done the exact same thing. By their own admission, the only real reason they've been adding the images is for spam like reasons, they want to promote their own work. As with a number of spammers, their COI means they likely genuinely believe their work is better than anything else, but really there's no reason for the community to waste a lot of time educating them when they're so unwilling to learn. If individual community members want to try and teach them that's fine. But there's zero reason to waste time at ANI on what's a clear cut case. If people are able to teach them on their talk page, they're free to request an unblock and I'm sure some admin will get to it. But it's not something the community should be expected to spend a great deal of time on. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] ([[User talk:Nil Einne|talk]]) 03:47, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
:::::::Let's not forget this is not the first time Moylesy98 has been at ANI. Even given that this discussion [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive981#User:Moylesy98]] was perhaps not worth responding to, I recall this discussion [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive1002#Uncivil and threatening comments by User:Moylesy98]] on an issue fairly related to what's going on here was at ANI for quite a long time which is also supported by the time stamps. And their block log shows they were unblocked for all of it [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&page=User%3AMoylesy98]. And [[Special:Contributions/Moylesy98]] shows a small number of edits during a fair amount of that time. So frankly, we've already given this editor way more latitude and waited more than long enough for them to seriously engage with us than we needed to. They've completely failed to do it any meaningful way, and instead have just continued to spam (by their own admission) in numerous ways. If anyone ever gets through to them then good. But really it's no major failing on our part that we didn't. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] ([[User talk:Nil Einne|talk]]) 04:00, 2 April 2019 (UTC)
::::::::P.S. I'm actually a strong believer that we're way too reluctant to unblock someone to allow them to participate in an AN//I discussion about them. IMO the copying over from talk business is more complicated for everyone than it needs to be. Unless there's good reason to think the editor isn't going to obey the condition, I think we should as a matter or routine on request, unblock someone to allow them to participate in the discussion about them with the understanding it's the only thing they're allowed to do. Any violation of this condition will of course lead to an instant reblock, and is likely to destroy their chances. (And we should perhaps also remind editors that [[WP:Bludgeoning]] discussion is likely to harm them.) But in my mind, this isn't really an issue here because 1) No one really seems to think the topic ban proposal as a replacement for the indef is worth it 2) They haven't asked. (This comes up most often with cban appeals.) That said, if a serious proposal did develop and Moylesy98 were to request, I'd support it here as well.

A young editor (that is young in development of skills; I am unsure of their age) might become better. A young editor might be understandably proud of a new camera and want to see their images used.

They do not have to be of immediate use and even poor quality images may turn out to be of value in the future when some unsuspected aspect of the image is identified as being of use. I think some of his images may have been denigrated, which could have exacerbated the situation. A few examples in the gallery should give an indication of how this editor's contributions might be of value. If totally blocked their interest in contributing to commons as well might be lost. The lack of competence in other aspects might well persuade admins to block for a while. I would not object if that were the case as much effort has been spent on dealing with this editor's incompetence already.

To clarify for you, the problem isn't that Dave occasionally takes good enough photos that are, or might be, useful.  The problem is that he doesn't seem to know what he's doing, so he takes many more poor quality photos than the accidental good ones.  But then he persists in insisting that "his" photos, are included in articles, regardless of whether they are better than others.  If they happen to be better than others, we should include them at least until better ones are available.  But more often than not they're not, and we therefore shouldn't.  If you want a few examples, take a look at these:

***In this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMoylesy98&type=revision&diff=891424377&oldid=891422694] the question of [[WP:COMPETENCE]] was first raised.

*'''Weak Support''': {{U|Mjroots}} edit restriction.  But real concerns there will be a difference of views over something or other that will soon escalate into {{U|Moylesy98}}'s simply being blocked again (hence ''weak'').  I'm not 100% convinced from the discussion on Moylesy98's talk page that they are a mindset that will not end up in a further problem, but I think there has been some progress.  I feel interactions between Moylesy98 and {{U|Tony May}} have high risk of escalating to a ban/block for Moylesy98 (I've thought that for a long time .... while the issues arising from Moylesy98's constributions are not specific or restricted to Tony May it seems likely it s an interaction with Tony would likely be the part of the lead up to a further.... voluntary IBAN here would be great but possibly not practical or workable).  I don't know if a restriction on the number of articles/images edited in a period would also help.  I'll disclose I've entered into a discussion with Tony may on an article this morning though I actually had drafted (and lost) a somewhat similar response here about two days ago.  I've also been watching this evolve since at least beginning of March.  I do hope Moylesy98 can see we are trying to be helpful but I am so concerned of the risk of a further block/ban [[User:Djm-leighpark|Djm-leighpark]] ([[User talk:Djm-leighpark|talk]]) 08:37, 17 April 2019 (UTC)
::{{u|Djm-leighpark}} I also have doubts re this issue. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try.

:* Never was about content ... it was about disruptive behaviour or whatever, and trying explore if there was any way of avoiding a indefinite block on someone and guidance for how it might be lifted.  It is about trying to explore a way allow someone to re-participate in a friendly way, a somewhat noble aim.  Its unhealthly and inappropriate this has been at ANI for so long and some sort of empathetic closure would be nice and perhaps within the derived spirit of [[WP:5P4]].  Positive guidance on user talk page about what might be needed to appeal a block (not just appeal but indication of acceptable behavior and indication of expections) to successfully re-integrate into the community might be a better way forward.

== Regarding my recent edits ==

Now I'd like to make it clear to everyone that I am about to wirte a lot so please be patient.

Regarding my recent edits on wikipedia, yes I have been a pain at times and when I have realised my mistakes as for example when I thought occupants were not needed on air accidents were there no survivors I made a quick and urgent redo. Look I'm not perfect ok, but until recently I decided to fix up some old accidents regarding Aeroflot, please see here: [[Aeroflot accidents and incidents]]. I have been fixing the infoboxes, the date formats, the summaries and adding occupants, ok to the vast majority of you, thats nothing. But I'd rather get those pages up to date regarding the layout and formatting. 

To start it off, I've had a user [[User:Samf4u]] send me messages stating editing the old Aeroflot pages are unconstructive. To make it clear how is it unconstructive to redo those old rarley edited pages. To him that it is considered uneeded but bear in mind after a minor discussion with another user I found that having dates set out as d/m/y was considered the best layout so thats what I did. In which I later changed into a function after I saw some popular accidents use said format. Anyways regarding Samf4u, we fell out recently and until now I've had about 3 of these unconstrucitve posts of him, in which I deleted and I will explain why:

A) The template he sent me says this and I quote " If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you may leave a message on my talk page". In which I did, he said he doesn't talk to disruptive users. So the template to me is rendered useless.

B) The template helps me in no way what-so-ever. I read the link about unconstructive edits once. My edits on the aeroflot accidents are not uneeded.

With my talk there are times when I delete parts from it. It's not that I 'cant take CRITISISM' as one user ''believes''. It's the fact that if I don't need it anymore or it does not serve a purpose to me then I don't keep it. Until recently as of this past 30 minutes while I'm tpying this message, I've had this user: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/The_face_of_the_moon. Undo my edit with Sam's template on. Like Ive said multiple times. I do not need it there, the template is a blatant lie as with the last two lines because I cannot discuss the 'unconstructive editing' with him.

I do want to improve but If everything I do is unconstrutive what is contructive. I love being here and the fact that I am being helped is something I appreciate. I've changed a lot since I firs started. I have discussions, or at least try to. But my goal today was to clean up the Aeroflot accidents, but if I cannot do something that people consider unconstrutive then what is the point? I mean they haven't touched it and before someone says that the pages are fine, have a look for yourself.

I am not here to deliberatly cause trouble or anything like that. There are air accidents that hit home to me. And after seeing small issues on a page, its how I became a user here, to make the pages look more presentable and not abandoned as with some of the Aeroflot accidents. 

Again I love being here and making changes that I see are good, I have common sense when it comes to editing like dont add silly stuff like foul langage etc etc. And in a way my Autism does get to me, but it does make me think creativly. I want to do good I seriosuly hand on heart mean that. But when I get my talk page undone by spam users such as these: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/The_face_of_the_moon its an utter pain. I don't mind the odd occasion bumping into people I dislike its when I get my page messed around with and comments such as 'i cant take CRTISISM' is what annoys me. 

Before I end this off, I want a friendly calm discussion as I really have had enough and I just want to be calm and cool around everyone. If theres a page about improvements or anything like that I'll go there. [[User:OrbitalEnd48401|OrbitalEnd48401]] ([[User talk:OrbitalEnd48401|talk]]) 17:21, 19 April 2019 (UTC)

== [[User:Horizonlove]] -- edit warring, obvious NFCC violations, BLP noncompliance ==

[[User:Horizonlove]]'s failure to comply with BLP and NFCC requirements has been noted by several editors,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martha_Wash&type=revision&diff=881853804&oldid=881698460][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AFirstLadiesofDisco.jpg&type=revision&diff=893129223&oldid=892609562]  most actively by me. Horizonlove has made no effort to address the policy issues involved, insisting mainly that so long as an image meets "fair use" requirements, failure to meet other NFCC requirements -- particularly regarding replaceability -- should be ignored. This is obviously not compliant with NFCC policies. 

For example, Horizonlove uploaded [[:File:FirstLadiesofDisco.jpg]] for use in the infobox of [[First Ladies of Disco]]. First Ladies of Disco is an active musical group. Horizonlove acknowledged in their use rationale that "The image is replaceable". Instead, Horizonlove insists that this replaceable image of living persons can be used should remain until someone provides a "better image". (see edit summary [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Weather_Girls&diff=prev&oldid=893122990]) Horizonlove has restored this obvious NFCC violation ''five times'' in the last two days, ''four time today alone'', sufficient to justify a 3RR block. (Note that removing image is exempt from 3RR limits; replaceable nonfree images are unquestionable NFCC violations.)

Horizonlove's behavior with regard to [[:File:TheWeatherGirls.jpg]] is quite similar. The file is acknowledged as nonfree replaceable. (Even a cursoty Ebay search turns up several apparently free alternatives.) The group is currently active, although it has undergone several membership changes. Horizonlove has repeatedly restored the image, violating 3RR today, insisting that it must be retained unless a "better" alternative is produced. This is plainly not compliant with NFCC policy.

Finally, with regard to [[Martha Wash]], Horizonlove has violated [[WP:BLP]] requirements by repeatedly adding and restoring the statement that Wash is a "devout Christian" while citing ostensible sources which do not ascribe such a statement of belief to the article subject. Horizonlove acknowledges that Wash has not "publicly self-identified with the belief" (particularly wrt the "devout" phrasing), saying that "It's safe to say she is a Christian and one of her favorite songs is "God bless the road")[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martha_Wash&type=revision&diff=881993861&oldid=881853804] and "She has gospel songs: "God Bless the Road", "You Lift Me Up", "I'm Still Standing", etc. She was also in a GOSPEL group which is mentioned in the article" [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martha_Wash&type=revision&diff=893327034&oldid=893325434]. While these inferences might be seen as reasonable, editor's inferences cannot be substituted for the express statement of belief required by BLP. (Cf the lengthy dispute over how to characterize Jodie Foster's sexuality.) Moreover, since at least two editors had challenged the statement, and none had supported Horizonlove's position, Horizonlove was required by BLP policy to achieve talk page consensus before restoring the disputed content. Horizonlove has also violated 3RR with regard to [[:File:PurpleRoseRecords.png]], the nonfree logo of a record label owned by Wash. Policy and practice are clear and well-established; as [[WP:LOGO]] states, a nonfree logo may be used in an article whose primary subject is the label itself, but it may not be used as an identifying image in an article on a different subject even if the subject is related.  No Apple logo in [[Steve Jobs]], no Def Jam logo in [[Rick Rubin]], no Tesla or SpaceX logo in [[Elon Musk]].

I could presumably have easily secured a simple 3RR sanction for the [[:File:FirstLadiesofDisco.jpg]] edit warring alone, but the general pattern of behaviour needs to be addressed. As another editor commented in an unsuccessful AFD Horizonlove initiated, Horizonlove's editing is marked by "a flat refusal to accept community decisions".[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FConflict_%28Sy_Smith_album%29_%282nd_nomination%29&type=revision&diff=887121373&oldid=886933937] Horizonlove has made no effort to address the governing policy issues, simply asserting their own views as to what ought to be allowed.

I therefore propose that Horizonlove be indefinitely blocked until they accept that 1) NFCC policies prohibit the use of replaceable nonfree images; and 2) when content is disputed under policies like BLP or NFCC, which place the burden of proof on the editor seeking to retain content, they will not restore disputed content without an appropriate talk page consensus. Perhaps a continuing 1RR restriction would be appropriate after the block is lifted. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|The Big Bad Wolfowitz (aka Hullaballoo).  Treated like dirt by many administrators since 2006.  ]] ([[User talk:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|talk]]) 19:14, 20 April 2019 (UTC)

:I'll address everything in the order of what was stated. This has nothing to do with other editors, only one (Hullaballoo Wolfowitz). Hullaballoo Wolfowitz started an edit war and is simply trying to hide by his own interpretations of Wikipedia polices. Starting with the [[:File:FirstLadiesofDisco.jpg]], I added a "fair use" rationale to the image, stating its use. I gave a total of six reasons why this is acceptable to use on the First Ladies of Disco page and it has not appeared in any other articles than the one mentioned. Under Wikipedia policy, that is acceptable. I also did the same thing for [[:File:TheWeatherGirls.jpg]]. However in that case, it also a historical image as one of the members in the photo is deceased which I noted again under "fair use" rationale. When it comes to [[Martha Wash]], two issues are happening there. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] insists on removing sourced information that notes Martha Wash as Christian. While it was not directly stated in the "Call Me Adam" source that I provided, it was heavily implied. But it was also stated that she was in the final chapter "Red Kimono" of The Fabulous Sylvester book, for which I listed the book a source. Additionally, Wash has been a gospel group (mentioned in the article) and has gospel songs that she has released in the past. Still, [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] wishes to be unnecessarily combative about that part. As for "While these inferences might be seen as reasonable, editor's inferences cannot be substituted for the express statement of belief required by BLP. (Cf the lengthy dispute over how to characterize Jodie Foster's sexuality.) Moreover, since at least two editors had challenged the statement, and none had supported Horizonlove's position, Horizonlove was required by BLP policy to achieve talk page consensus before restoring the disputed content.", I don't know who the second user is that Hullaballoo Wolfowitz is referring to as nobody has changed that information but himself. And I don't see how his example has anything to do with this situation. It would make no sense for a singer who isn't a Christian to release gospel songs on their own albums or to have been in a gospel group. So Hullaballoo Wolfowitz's Jodie Foster theory doesn't apply in this case. The second issue involves the [[:File:PurpleRoseRecords.png]], which was used only in [[Martha Wash#Purple Rose Records]] that specifically talks about the company itself, which Wash owns. I would have created another page, but I felt that was unnecessary because there may not be enough content to move it to another page, so I posted the logo there [on the Martha Wash]. I don't see how that violates the Wikipedia policy when the logo is being used the company's part of the page.

:To suggest a one-way indefinite block is highly inappropriate and foolish for following Wikipedia image policies. I did everything by the book and when I pointed that out to [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]], he began an edit war. Now if I am temporarily blocked for the edit war, that is fine because it takes two people to war but [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] should definitely share that block. However I have followed through on Wikipedia policies involving those images and its uses. [[User:Horizonlove|Horizonlove]] ([[User talk:Horizonlove|talk]]) 19:51, 20 April 2019 (UTC)

== Editing on [[SNC-Lavalin Affair]] by [[User:Curly Turkey]] and others ==

Hi, I'd like to get an outside look at the talk page discussions and article edits on this page. Certain edits by Curly Turkey have I think been uncivil. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891490136&oldid=891489516 "this kind of bullshit"], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891491600&oldid=891490544 "Jesus Christ, this is exasperating. (...) Do I have to hold your hand and walk you through our sourcing guidlines?"], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891625009&oldid=891619190 "Aside from your contempt for our sourcing guidelines, you seem to have a vested interest in including "LavScam" in the lead paragraph"], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891596445&oldid=891589232 "don't make a fool of yourself, Legacypac"], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891924215&oldid=891922180 "The belligerence some of these editors continue to show—and the facile dismissal of all evidence provided—demonstrates this is a behavioural issue that won't be solved through discussion. The bad faith is so thick you can cut it with a knife—just take a look at Legacypac's FUD that I'm pushing some unnamed "agenda" below."] (Referencing [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891919971&oldid=891918564 this] by Legacypac), [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891938386&oldid=891937807 "I've brought you to task over the intransigent, bad-faith, POV-pushing, policy-violating manner in which it is presented. ANI will decide whether you'll get away with it."])

Other edits have had less than civil remarks in the edit summaries, like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891635736&oldid=891633010 "a single-mindedness that should be treated with great suspicion"], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891911857&oldid=891882742 "WP:WEIGHT is WP:POLICY; if you continue to violate policy, we can sort this out at WP:ANI, if you'd like"], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891487666&oldid=891487221 "learn how to use a source"] 

I am also concerned about certain of their arguments regarding sources, but I don't know if this is the right place to talk about that. All other editors currently in the discussion also have disagreements with many of their policy arguments, and accusations of misbehaviour of different types have been raised by others. I have tried to be calm and reasonable, as well as to ask for more specificity in P&G citations, but I don't feel it's helped much.

I have said something to Curly which I'm not sure about civility status on: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891637984&oldid=891635736 "You don't need to ping me twice in the same reply to me on a page I'm watching. It comes off as aggressive and condescending, which I'm sure wasn't your intention."] I would like some outside advice or input, or something, on the whole state of the discussion and what the bar for civility is, because I thought it was higher than this. The relevant talk page sections begin at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair#Curly_Turkey_edits Curly Turkey Edits]. Curly has also opened a section on my talk page, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Safrolic#Sourcing Sourcing], about a couple reverts I made which make me think I've lost my patience. [[User:Safrolic|Safrolic]] ([[User talk:Safrolic|talk]]) 05:36, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
::I would like to second what Safrolic has written here.  Things have not improved since.  Other editors have tried to engage with Curly on improvements to the article but we are not able to discuss content.  Curly simply accuses anyone who disagrees with him of bad faith. When asked what specifically he thinks needs to be improved he tends to go silent or shift to allegations.  This is becoming extremely disruptive.  Unfortunately, I do not see this de-escalating without intervention.--[[User:Darryl Kerrigan|Darryl Kerrigan]] ([[User talk:Darryl Kerrigan|talk]])

Now [[User:Bradv]] has started edit warring [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&type=revision&diff=892100715&oldid=892100551] (second removal) and misrepresenting the talkpags discussion. When I reverted them once, adding yet another ref, they claimed it was all right wing media. Curly turkey needs a topic ban and Bradv needs a talking to. Google LavScam and look at how pretty much every media outlet in Canada and places like CNN (hardly right wing) are using this term. This is a politically charged topic and our job is to follow the socerces not whitewash the page and downplay everything. If many many media outlets call something X we also note that in the lede.

While attempting to copyedit [[SNC-Lavalin affair]], I kept running into sourcing issues: description of something [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891796823&oldid=891796742 as "illegal"] where none of the three cited sources did; description of a hashtag [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891485810&oldid=891480404 as a "colloquialsim",] later reverted three times[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891486464&oldid=891486208][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891918497&oldid=891911941][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891882742&oldid=891868040] with the same source about the term as a hashtag; Padding of a quotation with multiple sources, when [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891766133&oldid=891760249 only one gave the full quote;] and so on ...

I've tried to fix the article in various ways: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=892086575&oldid=892086395 adding sources,] rewording, and removing inappropriate sources.  I've run into considerable pushback from other editors there, including one who asserts sources are [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=892089500&oldid=892088064 "not required to support all the material in the paragraph, that's ridiculous"] while removing a {{better source needed}} tag.

The most concerning behaviour has been the insistence on including the term "LavScam" in the lead sentence.  The term is one of a large number of terms that have been used to describe the issue, including [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Wilson-Raybould%20scandal%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t "Wilson-Raybould scandal"], [https://www.google.com/search?ei=tiCwXOTWKcXa8QWCiKiIBw&q=%22PMO+scandal%22&oq=%22PMO+scandal%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...20106.22150..22650...0.0..0.189.1218.0j8......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i13j0i67j0i7i30.vAs2tgUVQMs "PMO scandal",] [https://www.google.com/search?ei=ziCwXPKWB8aE8gWD4o2IAw&q=%22Trudeau+scandal%22+lavalin&oq=%22Trudeau+scandal%22+lavalin&gs_l=psy-ab.3...23164.28657..28930...0.0..0.146.1539.16j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i7i30j0i67j0i13j0.2a1WSku7wOA "Trudeau scandal",] and a list of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891488718&oldid=891487833 variations of the article title] that I removed as redundant and predictable.  The only term the editors have fought to restore is "LavScam", despite the fact that several terms (that are not variations of the current title) return a greater number of Google hits (see screenshots).

Early on, I characterized the article's issues as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=891490136&oldid=891489516 "sloppy",] but the single-minded pushback over "LavScam" has made me suspicious.  I searched for how the media used this term and found it rare or nonexistent in outlets such as CBC News, the ''National Post'', and the ''Toronto Star'', but the favoured term in the right-wing tabloid [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22LavScam%22&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwizhs7s6cnhAhWEvLwKHXVfD_wQ_AUIDygC&biw=1600&bih=798 the ''Toronto Sun'']—in fact, {{em|two thirds}} of hits in a Google News search are from this single source ([https://www.google.com/search?biw=1600&bih=798&tbm=nws&ei=DAuxXL3LA4uP8wWz6ZRg&q=%22lavscam%22+&oq=%22lavscam%22+&gs_l=psy-ab.3...8660.10327.0.11337.15.10.0.0.0.0.145.832.9j1.10.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..8.0.0....0.oVH0cDJ8MVA "Lavscam": 4940 hits,] [https://www.google.com/search?biw=1600&bih=798&tbm=nws&ei=GAuxXOFxjPrxBZCunvgG&q=%22lavscam%22+-torontosun.com&oq=%22lavscam%22+-torontosun.com&gs_l=psy-ab.3...112580.117150.0.117719.16.16.0.0.0.0.137.1261.14j2.16.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.wQLtLg-rpEA {{'"}}Lavscam" -torontosun.com': 1,650 hits]).

I then went back through the article talk page and found a previous dispute these editors had had with [[User:Littleolive oil|User:Littleolive oil]] over who to highlight in the lead.  The affair is a divisive one in Canada, and there is no consensus over who is to blame.  [[User:Legacypac|Legacypac]] repsonded with this POV:

{{Quote|text=[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=886684574&oldid=886684320 "I prefer the PM's picture. This scandal is about him, not the former AG who was allegedly pressured"]}}

The AG being Wilson-Raybould; newssources differ on who is to blame, and many of them have named the scandal after Wilson-Raybould, the Prime Minister, or SNC-Lavalin.

Legacypac's [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&oldid=886269921 first edit] to the talk page was commentary "The most interesting part is how SNC paid for the son of a dictator to tour Canada hiring expensive call girls for him."  Legacypac and Littleolive then engaged in some editwarring until this comment was finally removed: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=886683728&oldid=886568257] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=886684057&oldid=886683728][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=886684320&oldid=886684057][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=886684574&oldid=886684320][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SNC-Lavalin_affair&diff=886686911&oldid=886684574].  Legacypac clearly has a POV and has a history of fighting for it on this article.  Other editors who have participated include [[User:Harris Seldon|Harris Seldon]], [[User:Darryl Kerrigan|Darryl Kerrigan]], and [[User:Safrolic|Safrolic]].

::: ... '''''Work in progress''': Persistent [[WP:IDONTHEARTHAT]] behaviour, and dismissal of empirical evidence and policies, including [[WP:INTEGRITY]], [[WP:WEIGHT]], [[WP:OR]], and [[WP:SYNTH]]'' ...

The consistent pushback against my attempts to clean up the article's sourcing, dismissal of numerous policies, single-minded focus on the term "LavScam", explicit expressions of POVs ... these have me suspicious of an [[astroturfing]] campaign there.  At the very least, these editors have demonstrated an unwillingness to respect Wikipedia's sitewide sourcing policies and, consciously or not, have repeatedly introduced and reinforced (sometimes through editwarring) POV into a politically-sensitive article.

My disagreement with Turkey was limited, I believe, to placing the term ''LavScam'' back in the article when others agreed it should be there (Turkey excluded) and disagreeing with Turkey in the Talk page.  It is regrettable that we find ourselves here.  There have been assumptions of bad faith largely all around (by myself included). It is clear though that on the distinct issue of the inclusion of ''LavScam'' in the article, which seems to have become the main lightning rod here, [[User:Curly Turkey|Curly Turkey]] has formed the view that others cannot disagree with him on this issue without acting in bad faith.

== Regarding my recent edits ==

Now I'd like to make it clear to everyone that I am about to wirte a lot so please be patient.

Regarding my recent edits on wikipedia, yes I have been a pain at times and when I have realised my mistakes as for example when I thought occupants were not needed on air accidents were there no survivors I made a quick and urgent redo. Look I'm not perfect ok, but until recently I decided to fix up some old accidents regarding Aeroflot, please see here: [[Aeroflot accidents and incidents]]. I have been fixing the infoboxes, the date formats, the summaries and adding occupants, ok to the vast majority of you, thats nothing. But I'd rather get those pages up to date regarding the layout and formatting. 

To start it off, I've had a user [[User:Samf4u]] send me messages stating editing the old Aeroflot pages are unconstructive. To make it clear how is it unconstructive to redo those old rarley edited pages. To him that it is considered uneeded but bear in mind after a minor discussion with another user I found that having dates set out as d/m/y was considered the best layout so thats what I did. In which I later changed into a function after I saw some popular accidents use said format. Anyways regarding Samf4u, we fell out recently and until now I've had about 3 of these unconstrucitve posts of him, in which I deleted and I will explain why:

A) The template he sent me says this and I quote " If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you may leave a message on my talk page". In which I did, he said he doesn't talk to disruptive users. So the template to me is rendered useless.

B) The template helps me in no way what-so-ever. I read the link about unconstructive edits once. My edits on the aeroflot accidents are not uneeded.

With my talk there are times when I delete parts from it. It's not that I 'cant take CRITISISM' as one user ''believes''. It's the fact that if I don't need it anymore or it does not serve a purpose to me then I don't keep it. Until recently as of this past 30 minutes while I'm tpying this message, I've had this user: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/The_face_of_the_moon. Undo my edit with Sam's template on. Like Ive said multiple times. I do not need it there, the template is a blatant lie as with the last two lines because I cannot discuss the 'unconstructive editing' with him.

I do want to improve but If everything I do is unconstrutive what is contructive. I love being here and the fact that I am being helped is something I appreciate. I've changed a lot since I firs started. I have discussions, or at least try to. But my goal today was to clean up the Aeroflot accidents, but if I cannot do something that people consider unconstrutive then what is the point? I mean they haven't touched it and before someone says that the pages are fine, have a look for yourself.

I am not here to deliberatly cause trouble or anything like that. There are air accidents that hit home to me. And after seeing small issues on a page, its how I became a user here, to make the pages look more presentable and not abandoned as with some of the Aeroflot accidents. 

Again I love being here and making changes that I see are good, I have common sense when it comes to editing like dont add silly stuff like foul langage etc etc. And in a way my Autism does get to me, but it does make me think creativly. I want to do good I seriosuly hand on heart mean that. But when I get my talk page undone by spam users such as these: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/The_face_of_the_moon its an utter pain. I don't mind the odd occasion bumping into people I dislike its when I get my page messed around with and comments such as 'i cant take CRTISISM' is what annoys me. 

Before I end this off, I want a friendly calm discussion as I really have had enough and I just want to be calm and cool around everyone. If theres a page about improvements or anything like that I'll go there. [[User:OrbitalEnd48401|OrbitalEnd48401]] ([[User talk:OrbitalEnd48401|talk]]) 17:21, 19 April 2019 (UTC)

== [[User:Horizonlove]] -- edit warring, obvious NFCC violations, BLP noncompliance ==

[[User:Horizonlove]]'s failure to comply with BLP and NFCC requirements has been noted by several editors,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martha_Wash&type=revision&diff=881853804&oldid=881698460][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AFirstLadiesofDisco.jpg&type=revision&diff=893129223&oldid=892609562]  most actively by me. Horizonlove has made no effort to address the policy issues involved, insisting mainly that so long as an image meets "fair use" requirements, failure to meet other NFCC requirements -- particularly regarding replaceability -- should be ignored. This is obviously not compliant with NFCC policies. 

For example, Horizonlove uploaded [[:File:FirstLadiesofDisco.jpg]] for use in the infobox of [[First Ladies of Disco]]. First Ladies of Disco is an active musical group. Horizonlove acknowledged in their use rationale that "The image is replaceable". Instead, Horizonlove insists that this replaceable image of living persons can be used should remain until someone provides a "better image". (see edit summary [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Weather_Girls&diff=prev&oldid=893122990]) Horizonlove has restored this obvious NFCC violation ''five times'' in the last two days, ''four time today alone'', sufficient to justify a 3RR block. (Note that removing image is exempt from 3RR limits; replaceable nonfree images are unquestionable NFCC violations.)

Horizonlove's behavior with regard to [[:File:TheWeatherGirls.jpg]] is quite similar. The file is acknowledged as nonfree replaceable. (Even a cursoty Ebay search turns up several apparently free alternatives.) The group is currently active, although it has undergone several membership changes. Horizonlove has repeatedly restored the image, violating 3RR today, insisting that it must be retained unless a "better" alternative is produced. This is plainly not compliant with NFCC policy.

Finally, with regard to [[Martha Wash]], Horizonlove has violated [[WP:BLP]] requirements by repeatedly adding and restoring the statement that Wash is a "devout Christian" while citing ostensible sources which do not ascribe such a statement of belief to the article subject. Horizonlove acknowledges that Wash has not "publicly self-identified with the belief" (particularly wrt the "devout" phrasing), saying that "It's safe to say she is a Christian and one of her favorite songs is "God bless the road")[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martha_Wash&type=revision&diff=881993861&oldid=881853804] and "She has gospel songs: "God Bless the Road", "You Lift Me Up", "I'm Still Standing", etc. She was also in a GOSPEL group which is mentioned in the article" [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martha_Wash&type=revision&diff=893327034&oldid=893325434]. While these inferences might be seen as reasonable, editor's inferences cannot be substituted for the express statement of belief required by BLP. (Cf the lengthy dispute over how to characterize Jodie Foster's sexuality.) Moreover, since at least two editors had challenged the statement, and none had supported Horizonlove's position, Horizonlove was required by BLP policy to achieve talk page consensus before restoring the disputed content. Horizonlove has also violated 3RR with regard to [[:File:PurpleRoseRecords.png]], the nonfree logo of a record label owned by Wash. Policy and practice are clear and well-established; as [[WP:LOGO]] states, a nonfree logo may be used in an article whose primary subject is the label itself, but it may not be used as an identifying image in an article on a different subject even if the subject is related.  No Apple logo in [[Steve Jobs]], no Def Jam logo in [[Rick Rubin]], no Tesla or SpaceX logo in [[Elon Musk]].

I could presumably have easily secured a simple 3RR sanction for the [[:File:FirstLadiesofDisco.jpg]] edit warring alone, but the general pattern of behaviour needs to be addressed. As another editor commented in an unsuccessful AFD Horizonlove initiated, Horizonlove's editing is marked by "a flat refusal to accept community decisions".[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FConflict_%28Sy_Smith_album%29_%282nd_nomination%29&type=revision&diff=887121373&oldid=886933937] Horizonlove has made no effort to address the governing policy issues, simply asserting their own views as to what ought to be allowed.

I therefore propose that Horizonlove be indefinitely blocked until they accept that 1) NFCC policies prohibit the use of replaceable nonfree images; and 2) when content is disputed under policies like BLP or NFCC, which place the burden of proof on the editor seeking to retain content, they will not restore disputed content without an appropriate talk page consensus. Perhaps a continuing 1RR restriction would be appropriate after the block is lifted. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|The Big Bad Wolfowitz (aka Hullaballoo).  Treated like dirt by many administrators since 2006.  ]] ([[User talk:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|talk]]) 19:14, 20 April 2019 (UTC)

:I'll address everything in the order of what was stated. This has nothing to do with other editors, only one (Hullaballoo Wolfowitz). Hullaballoo Wolfowitz started an edit war and is simply trying to hide by his own interpretations of Wikipedia polices. Starting with the [[:File:FirstLadiesofDisco.jpg]], I added a "fair use" rationale to the image, stating its use. I gave a total of six reasons why this is acceptable to use on the First Ladies of Disco page and it has not appeared in any other articles than the one mentioned. Under Wikipedia policy, that is acceptable. I also did the same thing for [[:File:TheWeatherGirls.jpg]]. However in that case, it also a historical image as one of the members in the photo is deceased which I noted again under "fair use" rationale. When it comes to [[Martha Wash]], two issues are happening there. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] insists on removing sourced information that notes Martha Wash as Christian. While it was not directly stated in the "Call Me Adam" source that I provided, it was heavily implied. But it was also stated that she was in the final chapter "Red Kimono" of The Fabulous Sylvester book, for which I listed the book a source. Additionally, Wash has been a gospel group (mentioned in the article) and has gospel songs that she has released in the past. Still, [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] wishes to be unnecessarily combative about that part. As for "While these inferences might be seen as reasonable, editor's inferences cannot be substituted for the express statement of belief required by BLP. (Cf the lengthy dispute over how to characterize Jodie Foster's sexuality.) Moreover, since at least two editors had challenged the statement, and none had supported Horizonlove's position, Horizonlove was required by BLP policy to achieve talk page consensus before restoring the disputed content.", I don't know who the second user is that Hullaballoo Wolfowitz is referring to as nobody has changed that information but himself. And I don't see how his example has anything to do with this situation. It would make no sense for a singer who isn't a Christian to release gospel songs on their own albums or to have been in a gospel group. So Hullaballoo Wolfowitz's Jodie Foster theory doesn't apply in this case. The second issue involves the [[:File:PurpleRoseRecords.png]], which was used only in [[Martha Wash#Purple Rose Records]] that specifically talks about the company itself, which Wash owns. I would have created another page, but I felt that was unnecessary because there may not be enough content to move it to another page, so I posted the logo there [on the Martha Wash]. I don't see how that violates the Wikipedia policy when the logo is being used the company's part of the page.

:To suggest a one-way indefinite block is highly inappropriate and foolish for following Wikipedia image policies. I did everything by the book and when I pointed that out to [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]], he began an edit war. Now if I am temporarily blocked for the edit war, that is fine because it takes two people to war but [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] should definitely share that block. However I have followed through on Wikipedia policies involving those images and its uses. [[User:Horizonlove|Horizonlove]] ([[User talk:Horizonlove|talk]]) 19:51, 20 April 2019 (UTC)
