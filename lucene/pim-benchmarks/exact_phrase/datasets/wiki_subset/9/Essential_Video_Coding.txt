MPEG-5 '''Essential Video Coding (EVC)''' is a future [[video compression standard]] that is expected to be completed in 2020.<ref name="ibc" /><ref name="meeting125" /><ref name="intro" />
The standard is to consist of a royalty-free subset and individually switchable enhancements.<ref name="meeting125" /><ref name="intro" /><ref name="req" />

== Concept ==
The publicly available requirement document<ref name="req"/>
outlines a development process that is defensive against patent threats:
Two sets of coding tools, ''base'' and ''enhanced'', are defined:
* The base consist of ''tools that were made public more than 20 years ago or for which a Type 1 declaration is received''. Type 1, or option 1, is ISO speak for royalty-free.<ref name="iso-speak"/>
* Tools in the enhanced set must pass an extra compression efficiency justification and be possible to disable individually.

Bitstream-switchable coding tools are also known from Divideon's XVC.<ref name="3codecs"/>

== Contributors ==

A proposal by [[Samsung]], [[Huawei]] and [[Qualcomm]] was selected as the basis for EVC.<ref name="3codecs"/> Divideon is among the editors of the standard.<ref name="smpte2019"/>

== Implementations ==

* REVC – a [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]]-based EVC baseline encoder and decoder<ref name="revc"/>
