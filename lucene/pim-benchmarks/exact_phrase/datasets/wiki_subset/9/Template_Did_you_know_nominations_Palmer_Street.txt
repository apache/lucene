: [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Solid article on good sources, offline sources accepted AGF, no copyvio obvious. The image is licensed and shows well, but I don't believe it's typical for that street, rather the exception, and as long as the sculptor has no article not necessarily worth mentioning. Another little problem I see is grammar, because I get the impression that the sculpture is still in place, so "was the location" doesn't fit. How about the more typical building pic? Or stop after the spy agency, which might be interesting enough? (And have the sculptor image with the artist's article?) --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 14:17, 6 April 2019 (UTC)
:::I will look at those things Gerda. Did you get that the spy building has a sculpture named ''Cypher'' opposite it (installed before the spying nature of the building was officially revealed)? [[User:Philafrenzy|Philafrenzy]] ([[User talk:Philafrenzy|talk]]) 20:40, 6 April 2019 (UTC)
:::: No, the hook doesn't say that, and for me, who had to look up cypher in a dictionary, the two things were not connected. Perhaps clarify that yes they are unconnected, but ''secretly'' look related ;) - more important than the sculptor's name. --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 21:28, 6 April 2019 (UTC)
::::::I don't think it's coincidence. I will look at doing the sculptor too. Here are spying Alts:
* '''ALT1'''... that '''[[Palmer Street]]''' was the location of a secret British spy base that intercepted the communications of London's embassies? 
* '''ALT2'''... that London's '''[[Palmer Street]]''' was the location of a secret "Dictionary" run by spies? [[User:Philafrenzy|Philafrenzy]] ([[User talk:Philafrenzy|talk]]) 22:16, 6 April 2019 (UTC)
:: I like them but think a link to the office would be helpful. --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 07:26, 7 April 2019 (UTC)
* '''ALT3''' ... that the London office of the British spy agency [[GCHQ]] was in '''[[Palmer Street]]''', opposite a sculpture by [[Tim Morgan]] titled ''Cypher'' ''(pictured)''?
:::We have no picture of the offices. [[User:Philafrenzy|Philafrenzy]] ([[User talk:Philafrenzy|talk]]) 08:03, 7 April 2019 (UTC)
:::: [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] that's it! ---[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 08:10, 7 April 2019 (UTC)
:::::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Returning from prep for further work. If the image is to be used, perhaps write a stub article about it so we can link it. Alternately, I'm un-striking ALT1 and ALT2 for reconsideration. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 19:44, 9 April 2019 (UTC)
:::::::Artist has an article, and his own DYK, but ''Cypher'' doesn't really qualify for an article of its own. [[User:Philafrenzy|Philafrenzy]] ([[User talk:Philafrenzy|talk]]) 19:51, 9 April 2019 (UTC)
::::::::ALT1 & ALT2 are more interesting, you could link "secret British spy base" and "Dictionary" to [[GCHQ]] if you think it's an issue, but the hook is about how quirky Palmer Street is, not anything else, and finding out about the spy base may be incentive to click the intended target link. I'd think the word cypher, since it's a very common noun in British English, is obvious enough that the original can be used and needs no explanation, surely.

This has been stuck since April, are there still any issues preventing this from being promoted again? {{ping|Yoninah|Philafrenzy|Whispyhistory|Edwardx|Kingsif|Gerda Arendt}}[[User:Narutolovehinata5|Narutolovehinata5]] <sup>[[User talk:Narutolovehinata5|t]][[Special:Contributions/Narutolovehinata5|c]][[WP:CSD|csd]][[Special:Newpages|new]]</sup> 02:55, 5 June 2019 (UTC)
: I feel I shouldn't. The one I liked was sent back. --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 05:37, 5 June 2019 (UTC)
::I can't see anything wrong with any of the hooks. Whoever objects had better explain why. [[User:Philafrenzy|Philafrenzy]] ([[User talk:Philafrenzy|talk]]) 07:55, 5 June 2019 (UTC)
::: [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] I approve ALT1, that seems to be safe ;) --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 08:11, 5 June 2019 (UTC)
