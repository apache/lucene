===Albania===
Gays and lesbians have been allowed to serve in the [[Military of Albania]] since 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/albania-passes-gay-hate-crimes-law-that-surpasses-the-u-s.html|title=Albania Passes Gay Hate Crimes Law That Surpasses the U.S.|work=care2.com}}</ref>

===Argentina===
As of 2009, the Argentine government has officially ended the ban on homosexuals in the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic|Argentine Armed Forces]]. A new military justice system was put into effect which decriminalizes homosexuality among uniformed members, and moves crimes committed exclusively within the military to the public justice sphere [previously there had been a separate military court system].

Under the old system, homosexuals were not permitted to have access to a military career, at the same time as this sexual orientation was penalized. And, while there are no publicly known former sanctions against homosexuals under the old policy, this does not mean that men and women with that sexual orientation have not been disciplined, and perhaps separated from the armed forces under a mantle of silence. In fact, with this new system, homosexuals who wish to train in the forces should encounter no impediment, nor any military retaliation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smink|first=Veronica|date=28 February 2009|title=Argentina: abren paso a gays en FF.AA.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7916000/7916193.stm|language=Spanish|work=[[BBC Mundo]]|location=|access-date=27 July 2017 }}</ref>

===Belgium===
Belgium permits homosexuals to serve openly in the [[Belgian Armed Forces]].<ref name="palmcenter" /> In Belgium, the military accepts gay men and lesbians into service. However, if the behaviour of an individual who is gay or lesbian causes problems, that individual is subject to discipline or discharge. In some cases, homosexual personnel have been transferred from their unit if they have been too open with their sexuality. The Belgian military also continues to reserve the right to deny gay and lesbian personnel high-level security clearances, for fear they may be susceptible to blackmail.<ref name="Military Culture: Europe">[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/military_culture_eur.html Military Culture: Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121165333/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/military_culture_eur.html|date=2005-11-21 }} glbtq: An encyclopaedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender & queer culture.</ref>

===Bermuda===
The [[Military of Bermuda]] does not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation, as it is formed by random lottery-style [[conscription]].

===Brazil===
There is no law forbidding lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people from serving in the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]]. Sexual orientation and gender identity cannot be an obstacle for entry into the police force or the military in Brazil, and some [[trans women]] and [[Travesti (gender identity)|travesti]]s should make [[conscription]], like some Brazilian male citizens. All sexual acts are disallowed between members of the forces, be they heterosexual or homosexual.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.fcs.edu.uy/investigacion/observatorioFFAA/Informe%20Brasil/Informe%20Brasil013.htm LGBT people and Military service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002175140/http://www.fcs.edu.uy/investigacion/observatorioFFAA/Informe%20Brasil/Informe%20Brasil013.htm|date=October 2, 2006 }}</ref>

The [[Constitution of Brazil]] prohibits any form of [[Anti-discrimination laws in Brazil|discrimination]] in the country. The Brazilian Armed Forces does not permit [[desertion]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]] or congeners in the military, whether heterosexual or homosexual. They claim that it is not a homophobic rule, but a rule of [[discipline]] that also includes the opposite sex.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://blogdofavre.ig.com.br/2010/06/final-feliz-na-caserna/ Final feliz na caserna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005035117/http://blogdofavre.ig.com.br/2010/06/final-feliz-na-caserna/|date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2008, during the disappearance of a military gay couple, the Ministry of Defence of Brazil spoke: "the sergeant is to be questioned about alleged [[desertion]] from the military and there is no question of discrimination." The two soldiers said they had been in a stable relationship for ten years in the Brazilian military.<ref>{{cite news|last=Duffy|first=Gary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7438867.stm|title=BBC: Gay soldier's fate grips Brazil|work=BBC News|date=2008-06-05|accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>

No information currently exists as to whether military personnel can have their same-sex relationships recognized by the military, despite the fact that federal government employees can receive benefits for their same-sex spouses. Following the Supreme Federal Tribunal [[ADI 4277 and ADPF 132|decision in favor of civil unions]], Defense Minister [[Nelson Jobim]] guaranteed the Ministry's compliance with the decision and mentioned that spousal benefits can be accorded to same-sex spouses of military personnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/noticia/2011-05-06/forcas-armadas-vao-garantir-direitos-de-casais-gays-diz-jobim|title=Armed Forces will guarantee rights of gay couples, says Jobim|author=Flavia Villela|date=2011-05-06|publisher=Agência Brasil|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813190702/http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/noticia/2011-05-06/forcas-armadas-vao-garantir-direitos-de-casais-gays-diz-jobim|archivedate=2011-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pop.com.br/popnews/noticias/politica/483700-Jobim_diz_que_vai_analisar_como_decisao_do_STF_sobre_casais_gays_afeta_as_Forcas_Armadas.html|title=Jobim says it will examine how the Supreme Court decision on gay couples affects the Armed Forces|date=2011-05-06|publisher=POP|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234454/http://www.pop.com.br/popnews/noticias/politica/483700-Jobim_diz_que_vai_analisar_como_decisao_do_STF_sobre_casais_gays_afeta_as_Forcas_Armadas.html|archivedate=2014-06-06}}</ref>

===Canada===
{{Main|Sexual orientation and the Canadian military}}
As of 1992, lesbians, gays and bisexuals are allowed to serve openly in the military. A study of gays and lesbians in the Canadian military has found that after Canada's 1992 decision to allow homosexuals to serve openly in its armed forces, military performance did not decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/publications/dadt/effects_of_the_1992_lifting_of_restrictions_on_gay_and_lesbian_service_in_the_canadian_forces_appraising_the_e|title=Effects of the 1992 Lifting of Restrictions on Gay and Lesbian Service in the Canadian Forces: Appraising the Evidence|work=Palm Center|accessdate=12 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725185044/http://www.palmcenter.org/publications/dadt/effects_of_the_1992_lifting_of_restrictions_on_gay_and_lesbian_service_in_the_canadian_forces_appraising_the_e|archivedate=25 July 2011}}</ref><ref>Suzanne B.

The study is the most comprehensive academic study by US researchers of homosexuality in a foreign military ever compiled and reflects an exhaustive inventory of relevant data and research. Its title is "Effects of the 1992 Lifting of Restrictions on Gay and Lesbian Service in the Canadian Forces; Appraising the Evidence".

* Lifting of restrictions on gay and lesbian service in the Canadian Forces has not led to any change in military performance, [[unit cohesion]], or discipline.
* Self-identified gay, lesbian, and transsexual members of the Canadian Forces contacted for the study describe good working relationships with peers.
* The number of military women who experienced sexual harassment dropped 46% after the ban was lifted. While there were several reasons why harassment declined, one factor was that after the ban was lifted women were free to report assaults without fear that they would be accused of being a lesbian.
* Before Canada lifted its gay ban, a 1985 survey of 6,500 male soldiers found that 62% said that they would refuse to share showers, undress or sleep in the same room as a gay soldier. After the ban was lifted, follow-up studies found no increase in disciplinary, performance, recruitment, sexual misconduct, or resignation problems.
* None of the 905 assault cases in the Canadian Forces from November, 1992 (when the ban was lifted) until August, 1995 involved gay bashing or could be attributed to the sexual orientation of one of the parties.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/world/canadian-military-can-t-bar-homosexuals-a-court-rules.html?pagewanted=1</ref>
A news article by Canadian journalist, Jon Tattrie, reported on the changed attitude towards the presence of homosexual members of the Canadian Forces in his article "Being Gay in the Military" (''[[Metro International|Metro Ottawa]]''), quoting Canadian Forces spokesperson Rana Sioufi as saying: "Members who are same-sex partners are entitled to the same respect and dignity as heterosexual married couples or common-law partners."<ref name=metroottawa>Tattrie, Jon (20 August 2010).

The [[Military of Chile]] does not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation. Chile bans all anti-gay discrimination since 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/04/chile-congress-passes-anti-discrimination-law.php|title=Chile Congress passes anti-discrimination law|publisher=Jurist.org|accessdate=2013-05-04 }}</ref>

On August 13, 2014, The Defense Ministry ordered the creation of a new committee to monitor inclusion and tackle discrimination in the armed forces, a move hailed as a "historic" step by gay rights campaigners.
Marcos Robledo, defense undersecretary, announced the formation of a Diversity and Anti-Discrimination Committee with the aim to eradicate arbitrary discrimination in the military.
The resolution, signed by Defense Minister Jorge Burgos, established the government as responsible for creating a more inclusive armed services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://santiagotimes.cl/gay-rights-group-lauds-efforts-make-chilean-military-inclusive/|title=Gay rights group lauds efforts to make Chilean military more inclusive|publisher=Santiagotimes.cl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816094928/http://santiagotimes.cl/gay-rights-group-lauds-efforts-make-chilean-military-inclusive/|archivedate=2014-08-16}}</ref>

Few days later, a sailor in Chile became the first serving member of the Chilean armed forces to announce he is gay.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-28961883|title=Chilean sailor makes history after announcing he is gay|journal=BBC News|date=2014-08-28}}</ref> Mauricio Ruiz, 24, told a televised news conference his decision had "not been easy", but he wanted to help fight discrimination against homosexuals. Mr Ruiz said that what was most important was not a soldier's sexual orientation, but his or her willingness to serve the country. His announcement came with the full backing of the Chilean armed.
Mauricio Ruiz said homosexuals had "no reason to hide". "We can do anything, be marines or in any branch (of the military). We can do whatever profession, and we deserve as much respect as anyone else," he told reporters in the Chilean capital, Santiago. "In life there's nothing better than to be yourself, to be authentic, to look at people in the eye and for those people to know who you are."

Rolando Jimenez, president of Chile's Movement for Integration and Homosexual Liberation, expressed his gratitude to the Chilean Navy. "(The Navy is) telling the country and the members of the institution particularly that it is possible for gays and lesbians to be part of the armed forces and that they aren't going to suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation within these institutions," Mr Jimenez said.

===Colombia===
In 1999 the Colombian Constitutional Court ruled that the prohibition of homosexuals from serving in the armed forces is unconstitutional and members of the LGBT community may serve openly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-918685 |title=Sí A Homosexuales, Con Discreción |trans-title=Yes To Gays, With Discretion |publisher=Eltiempo.com |accessdate=2013-11-12 |language=Spanish|date=1999-07-15 }}</ref>

===Croatia===
LGBT persons are not banned from participation in military service. [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Ministry of Defence]] has no internal rules regard LGBT persons, but it follows regulation at the state level which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Some media reports have suggested that most gay men serving in the military generally decide to keep their sexual orientation private, but there have also been reports suggesting that the [[Military of Croatia|Croatian Armed Forces]] take discrimination very seriously and will not tolerate homophobia among its personnel.<ref>{{cite web|author=Orhidea Gaura|url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/94181/biti-gay-u-hrvatskoj-vojsci|title=Biti gay u Hrvatskoj vojsci – Nacional.hr|publisher=Arhiva.nacional.hr|date=2012-06-29|accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/hrvatska-vojska-gay-je-ok-34439|title=Hrvatska vojska: Gay je OK - Večernji.hr|publisher=Vecernji.hr|date=|accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>

The "Working Committee of Homosexual Employees in the Military Forces"<ref>[http://www.ahsab.de/ A.H.s.A.B.&nbsp;– Arbeitskreis homosexueller Angehöriger der Bundeswehr] (Site is only in German)</ref> is the organization that represents the interests of gay men and lesbians in the armed forces. Heterosexuals and homosexuals alike are allowed to engage in sexual activity while in the military service as long as it does not interfere with the performance of their duties. Lesbian and gay soldiers are also entitled to enter civil unions as defined by Germany's domestic "partnership" law.<ref name=queer>{{cite news|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=10083|title=Argentinien und die Philippinen beenden Homo-Verbot im Militär|trans-title=Argentina and the Philippines end the military gay ban|publisher=queer.de|date=March 4, 2009|language=German|accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>

The [[Bundeswehr]] maintained a "[[glass ceiling]]" policy that effectively banned homosexuals from becoming officers until 2000. First Lieutenant Winfried Stecher, an army officer demoted for his homosexuality, filed a lawsuit against former Defense Minister [[Rudolf Scharping]]. Scharping vowed to fight the claim in court, claiming that homosexuality "raises serious doubts about suitability and excludes employment in all functions pertaining to leadership." However, before the case went to trial, the Defense Ministry reversed the discriminatory policy. While the German government declined to issue an official explanation for the reversal, it is widely believed that Scharping was overruled by then Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and then Vice-Chancellor [[Joschka Fischer]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Currently, according to general military orders given in the year 2000, tolerance towards all sexual orientations is considered to be part of the duty of military personnel. Sexual relationships and acts amongst soldiers outside service times, regardless of the sexual orientation, are defined to be "irrelevant", regardless of the rank and function of the soldier(s) involved, while harassment or the abuse of functions is considered a transgression, as well as the performance of sexual acts in active service.<ref>Cf. two orders of 2000: {{cite web|url=http://www.ahsab.de/recherche.php?aktion=show_one&show=Recherche&id=16&download=Anlage%20B%20173.pdf|title=Anlage B 173 zu ZDv 14/3|accessdate=24 December 2008|author=German Military Forces (Bundeswehr)|year=2000|publisher=Working Group 'Homosexuals in the Bundeswehr'|language=German|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023737/http://www.ahsab.de/recherche.php?aktion=show_one&show=Recherche&id=16&download=Anlage%20B%20173.pdf|archivedate=6 February 2009}} ; and {{cite web|url=http://www.ahsab.de/recherche.php?aktion=show_one&show=Recherche&id=16&download=sexualitaet.pdf|title=Führungshilfe für Vorgesetzte&nbsp;– Sexualität|accessdate=24 December 2008|author=Inspector General of the German Military Forces (Bundeswehr)|year=2000|publisher=Working Group 'Homosexuals in the Bundeswehr'|language=German|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023720/http://www.ahsab.de/recherche.php?aktion=show_one&show=Recherche&id=16&download=sexualitaet.pdf|archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}</ref>

A policy in 1983 allowed prospective Israeli soldiers to be questioned about their sexual orientation.

While no official statistics are available for harassment rates of sexual minorities in the IDF, scholars, military officials and representatives of gay organizations alike assert that vicious harassment is rare.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} A study published by the [[Israel Gay Youth]] Movement in January 2012 found that half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=273609], "Does viral IDF Gay Pride photo show full picture?"

Even though the law states that gay soldiers cannot be discriminated against by the Israeli military, does not mean it does not occur between soldiers. Ben-Ari and Kaplan, the scholars who wrote “Sexual Orientation and Military Service”, discovered that gay Israeli soldiers faced discrimination from their fellow military men because they were viewed as mentally ill, lonely, and insecure.<ref name="auto1">Ben-Ari, Kaplan, "Brothers and Others in Army," 402.</ref> Ben- Ari and Kaplan cited a study about how an Israeli soldier's sexual partner preference influenced the way they were treated.  The study conveyed that soldiers bonded in the Israeli military through homophobic remarks and sexualizing women.<ref name="auto1"/> There was another study that scholars Ben-Ari and Kaplan created that determined how gay Israeli soldiers responded to the macho man stereotype in the military. Gay soldiers either isolated themselves from the rest of the soldiers or attempted to adapt to heterosexual norms. In the end, gay soldiers' military performance was not affected by their response but their integration into the military was affected.<ref>Ben-Ari, Kaplan, "Brothers and Others in Army," 421</ref>

{{main|Sexual orientation and gender identity in the United States military}}
Homosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the [[United States]] military. Military policy and legislation had previously entirely prohibited gay individuals from serving, and subsequently from serving openly, but these prohibitions were ended in September 2011 after the U.S. Congress voted to repeal the policy.

The first time homosexuals were differentiated from non-homosexuals in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942. Additional policy revisions in 1944 and 1947 further codified the ban. Throughout the next few decades, homosexuals were routinely discharged, regardless of whether they had engaged in sexual conduct while serving. In response to the [[LGBT movements in the United States|gay rights movements]] of the 1970s and 1980s, including the famed [[Vernon Berg, III|"Copy" Berg case]], the Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service. Controversy over this policy created political pressure to amend the policy, with [[liberalism in the United States|socially liberal]] efforts seeking a repeal of the ban and [[conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] groups wishing to reinforce it by statute.

A legislative policy was enacted in a 1993 bill signed by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The new policy continued the ban under which homosexuals were prohibited from serving in the military and their discharge was required. The main change that the new policy made was to prohibit investigation into a member's sexual orientation without suspicion. The new policy was known as "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" and was seen as a compromise between the two political efforts.

Pressure to overturn the ban continued to build throughout the 1990s and 2000s, as public opposition to gay rights waned. In December 2010, a Democratically controlled House and a Democratically controlled Senate passed and President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]] which created a future pathway to allow homosexuals to serve in the military.<ref>{{cite news|last=Broverman|first=Neal|url=http://advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/12/20/Repeal_To_Be_Signed_Wednesday/|title=Repeal to be Signed Wednesday|publisher=Advocate.com|date=2010-12-20|accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref> Under the terms of the bill, the "Don't ask, don't tell" policy remained in place until the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60 days waiting period.<ref name="us-wapo-201106">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/gates-open-to-ending-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-he-goes/2011/06/13/AGwtRMUH_blog.html|title=Gates open to ending 'don't ask, don't tell' before leaving|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 13, 2011|first=Ed|last=O'Keefe}}</ref><ref name="chsc-2011">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0404/Pentagon-Don-t-ask-don-t-tell-could-be-gone-by-September|title=Pentagon: 'Don't ask, don't tell' could be gone by September|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|author=Anna Mulrine|date=April 4, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Obama_Signed">{{cite news|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|title=With Obama's Signature, 'Don't Ask' Is Repealed|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 22, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/politics/23military.html|accessdate=December 22, 2010}}</ref> In early 2011, military leaders began issuing training plans for the expected repeal of the ban.<ref name="chsc-2011" /><ref name="us-wapo-2011">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/13/AR2011021302780.html|title=Ending 'don't ask, don't tell' doesn't end problems facing gay service members|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 13, 2011|first=Ed|last=O'Keefe}}</ref><ref name="us-yahoo-2011">{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_gays_in_military|title=Navy set training for don't ask, don't tell repeal|work=[[Yahoo!

[[LGBT rights in South Korea|Civil rights for homosexual citizens]] are guaranteed in South Korea under the Korean Human Rights Committee Law, but in practice homosexuals may still face discrimination during military service, which is [[conscription in South Korea|mandatory for all male citizens]]. Conscripts are profiled at the time of enlistment and homosexuals may be categorized as having a "mental handicap" or "personality disorder", which may lead to a dishonourable discharge.

Article 92 of the Military Penal Code categorizes sexual relations between members of the same sex as "sexual harassment", regardless of whether it is consensual. Consensual sex between homosexuals may be regarded as "reciprocal rape", punishable by up to a year's imprisonment for both parties. These laws and practices have faced legal challenges during recent years.<ref name="Korea Upholds Antigay Military Law">{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2011/03/31/korea-upholds-antigay-military-law|title=Korea Upholds Antigay Military Law|work=Advocate.com|date=2011-03-31}}</ref>
