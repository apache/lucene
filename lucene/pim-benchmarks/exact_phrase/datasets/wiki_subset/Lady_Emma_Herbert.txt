==Latter life and career==
Herbert's parents did not fight her eccentric lifestyle. On leaving school, she went to [[New York City|New York]], where she lived in a [[Lower East Side]] [[squatting|house]]. She later commented "It was straight from [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] to [[Crack cocaine|crack dens]], [[Substance dependence|junkie]]s, shootings. I saw lots of very ugly things which made me decide I didn’t want to do them myself."<ref name=ottc/>

On her return to England, Herbert met a performance art group, [[Mutoid Waste Company]], and one of them became her boyfriend. She learnt acrobatic skills from the ''Mutoids'' and toured Europe with them. Other friends at that time included the pop group [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]] and the singer [[Lemmy]], of [[Motörhead]].<ref name=ottc/> 

She became a stuntwoman, getting her first job in ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', and said in an interview "I whiplashed my spine falling out of a tree, but it was brilliant fun jumping through explosions and coming out of the sea in leather loincloths".<ref name=ottc/> 

She then joined 'Generating Company', also known as 'Genco', a circus theatre group, appearing with them around Europe. In 2002, she performed at the [[Privilege Ibiza|Privilege]] [[night-club]] on the island of [[Ibiza]], better known for its sex shows.<ref name=revisited/><ref name=ottc/>  
 
In 2003, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported on her work as a [[trapeze]] artist and [[acrobatics|acrobat]], calling her "one of Britain’s leading exponents... Nobody can question her hard work and bravery" and noting that she was at the cutting edge of modern circus. She then had spiky pink hair, with a black badger streak, and a chin stud.<ref name=ottc/>

In 2004, she was a trapeze artist at 'Time', a club in [[Naas]], [[County Kildare]], [[Ireland]], where she was reported to be the star attraction.<ref name=revisited/>
