'''''The Pregnant Widow''''' is a novel by the English writer [[Martin Amis]], published by [[Jonathan Cape]] on 4 February 2010.<ref name=pressrelease>[http://www.booktrade.info/index.php/showarticle/25311 Martin Amis Launch Event 'The Pregnant Widow'], booktrade.info, accessed 2 February 2010.</ref> Its theme is the feminist revolution, which Amis sees as incomplete and bewildering for women, echoing the view of the 19th-century Russian writer, [[Alexander Herzen]], that revolution is "a long night of chaos and desolation".<ref>Herzen, Alexander. ''From the other shore: and The Russian people and socialism, an open letter to Jules Michelet''. G. Braziller, 1956.</ref> The "pregnant widow", a phrase taken from Herzen's ''[[From the other shore]]'' (1848&ndash;1850), is the point at which the old order has given way, the new one not yet born.<ref name=Bilmes2/> Amis said in 2007 that "consciousness is not revolutionised by the snap of a finger. And feminism, I reckon, is about halfway through its second trimester."<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/martin-amis-you-ask-the-questions-432146.html Martin Amis. You ask the questions], ''The Independent'', 15 January 2007.</ref></blockquote>

The story is set in a castle owned by a cheese tycoon in [[Campania]], Italy, where Keith Nearing, a 20-year-old English literature student; his girlfriend, Lily; and her friend, Scheherazade, are on holiday during the hot summer of 1970, the year that Amis says "something was changing in the world of men and women".<ref name=Long>Long, Camilla.

The novel was a work-in-progress for the best part of seven years, his first since ''[[House of Meetings]]'' (2006). Originally set for release in late 2007, its publication was delayed to 2008, when he made what he describes as a "terrible decision" to abandon what he had written to that point, and begin again, building the story up from one section he retained, the part about Italy.<ref name=Bilmes2>Bilmes, Alex.

==Background==
Amis started writing the novel after the publication in 2003 of ''[[Yellow Dog (novel)|Yellow Dog]]'' to a hostile critical reception and muted commercial success. In a 2006 interview with ''The Independent'', he revealed that he had abandoned a novella, ''The Unknown Known'', and instead continued to work on a follow-up full novel that he had started in 2003. He said the new novel was "blindingly autobiographical, but with an Islamic theme".<ref name=Bilmes1>Bilmes, Alex. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/martin-amis-30-things-ive-learned-about-terror-418950.html Martin Amis: 30 things I've learned about terror], ''The Independent'', 8 October 2006.</ref> In an interview with Mark Lawson in 2006, Amis said there was some distance from the fictionalised versions of himself, his father, [[Kingsley Amis]] and his novelist mentor, [[Saul Bellow]], in ''The Pregnant Widow'', at this point untitled. He said he was "trying to keep up a little bit of indirection" with the autobiographical aspects, saying that his character in the novel was named "Louis" (Amis' middle name), that Kingsley Amis was "The King" and that Saul Bellow was "Chick" (which itself was a reference to the Saul Bellow proxy character in Bellow's final novel ''[[Ravelstein]]'').<ref>Lawson, Mark. Interview with Martin Amis, Front Row, BBC Radio 4, 26 September 2006.</ref>

Further details concerning the struggle to get the novel written emerged on 1 August 2009 during an interview Amis gave the ''National Post'': "I started a novel [but] then I’m going to write a novella before I get on to it. But I was in big trouble a few years ago, with a huge, dead novel. And it took me a long time, and a lot of grief, to realize—I thought I was clutching at straws—it turned out it was actually two novels, and they couldn't go together. So I wrote ''The Pregnant Widow'', [that’s] one half of it, and the other half I started, and it will be very autobiographical, the next one."<ref>Medley, Mark. [http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/afterword/archive/2009/08/01/q-amp-a-with-martin-amis-quot-there-s-only-one-way-of-judging-quality-and-that-s-time-quot.aspx Q&A with Martin Amis: "There's only one way of judging quality and that's time"], ''The National Post'', 1 August 2009.</ref>

===Sally Amis===
The character of Violet Nearing, the protagonist's younger sister, is based on Sally Myfanwy Amis (19 January 1954 – 8 November 2000), Martin's younger sister by five years. She had problems all her life with [[alcoholism]] and was described by Amis as one of the sexual revolution's most spectacular victims.<ref>Flood, Alison. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/20/martin-amis-novel-feminists-sister Martin Amis says new novel will get him 'in trouble with the feminists'], ''The Guardian'', 20 November 2009.</ref> At age 24 she gave birth to a daughter, Catherine, who was given up for adoption at three months. Sally suffered a stroke at 40 and died of an infection at age 46.<ref name=Adams>Adams, Stephen. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/6615552/Martin-Amis-the-sexual-revolution-killed-my-sister-Sally.html Martin Amis: the sexual revolution killed my sister Sally], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 21 November 2009.</ref>

==Reception==
The novel was published to mixed reviews, [[Eileen Battersby]] in ''The Irish Times'' calling it a "thumping disappointment", while Richard Bradford in ''The Spectator'' described it as a "unique, sometimes exquisite experience".<ref>Battersby, Eileen. [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0206/1224263856904.html Amis aims high . . . and misses], ''The Irish Times'', 6 February 2010; Bradford, Richard. [http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5749218/it-happened-one-summer.thtml It happened one summer], ''The Spectator, 3 February 2010.</ref>

After a considerable amount of speculation and high expectation, the novel was not included on the longlist for the 2010 [[Booker Prize|Man Booker Prize]].
