'''Morning zoo''' is a format of morning [[radio show]] common to English-language radio [[broadcasting]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Alexander | last=Zaitchik | title=The Making of Glenn Beck: His Roots, from the Alleged Suicide of His Mom to Top 40 Radio to the Birth of the Morning Zoo, Part 1 of 3 | date=September 21, 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/09/21/glenn_beck/print.html | work =[[Salon (website)|Salon]] | pages = | accessdate = October 6, 2009 }}</ref> The name is derived from the wackiness and zaniness of the activities, segments, and overall personality of the show and its hosts.  The morning zoo concept and name is most often deployed on [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 (CHR)]] radio stations.

A morning zoo typically consists of two or more radio personalities, usually capable of spontaneous comic interaction as well as competent delivery of news and service elements. Most morning zoo programs involve scripted or live telephone calls, on-air games, and regular contests.

==History==
The first morning zoo program, focusing on the zany interactions of two hosts, was conceived and performed in 1981 by [[Scott Shannon]] and [[Cleveland Wheeler]] of [[WRBQ-FM]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], known at the time as Q105 FM. Wheeler had been serving as the [[Radio personality|personality DJ]] hosting the morning drive program for the station's previous four years. Shannon was the new operations manager in January 1981.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/61192835/cleveland-wheeler-scott-shannon-know/ |title=Cleveland Wheeler, Scott Shannon know what it's like to work in a zoo |date=July 15, 1981 |last=Goldstein |first=Linda |newspaper=[[The Tampa Times]] |page=B1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{open access}}</ref> The two decided to break with tradition and work up a wilder show together, founded on their own playful, irreverent and provocative interaction, with spontaneous bits of parody and comedy leavened with straight news. They called the show the ''Q Morning Zoo'', and it quickly became a hit. At its height it had 85 people working to produce it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tbo.com/news/recalling-the-days-of-q-morning-zoo-245349 |title=Recalling the Days of Q Morning Zoo |last=Belcher |first=Walt |date=July 21, 2011 |newspaper=The Tampa Tribune}}</ref>

(Prior to this development, radio station [[KZEW]] in Dallas was known as "the Zoo" because of its call letters. Beginning in September–October 1976, morning DJ [[Charlie Kendall]] hosted a zany show initially named ''Zooloos In Your Morning'', the name being a wordplay on the [[Zulu people]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.98kzew.com/zooads/kzew-zooloos-your-morning-sept76 |title=Zooloos In Your Morning |first=Charlie |last=Kendall |publisher=KZEW |date=September 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thezoofile.com/KZEW_1976.html |title=1976 |publisher=KZEW}}</ref> However, Kendall's was a one-man show, not a "zoo" with multiple radio personalities.)

In July 1983, Shannon left Tampa to reinvent [[WHTZ]] "Z-100" in the [[New York City]] market, based out of [[Secaucus, New Jersey]]. On August 2, Shannon hosted the first ''Z Morning Zoo'' at WHTZ, soon settling into a team which included straight man Ross Brittain, newscaster Claire Stevens, public service director Professor Jonathan B. Bell, 22-year-old "Captain" Kevin on the phones, and production manager J. R. Nelson. Shannon's popular new format brought WHTZ from last place to first in just 74 days, and put longtime #1 morning DJ [[Don Imus]] in second place.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-cCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA46 |page=46 |title=The Wizard of Z100: Scott Shannon, Tops in Pop Radio |last=Schwartz |first=Tony |date=April 2, 1984 |journal=New York |volume=17 |number=14 |issn=0028-7369}}</ref> When WHTZ became a huge ratings success, the name and format of the "Morning Zoo" was copied by stations across the USA.

[[John Gorman (radio)|John Gorman]] was a program director at [[Cleveland]] rock station [[WMMS]] when they adopted the morning zoo concept in early 1984. Gorman traced the sequence of events: {{quotation|We borrowed the 'Morning Zoo' moniker from our New York sister station Z-100, which borrowed it from WRBQ in Tampa, which borrowed it from a station in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gorman |first= John|date=September 9, 2009|title=Jeff and Flash and the Buzzard Morning Zoo|url=http://buzzardbook.wordpress.com/2008/09/09/761/|work=BuzzardBook |publisher=WordPress.com|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>}}

Tampa's WRBQ continued to run the morning zoo show after Shannon left; Wheeler teamed with Terrence McKeever and others to keep the show a success.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cookin' with the Q-Zoo: Radio's 'Red Hot' Recipe Book |page=6 |first1=Joyce S. |last1=Lafray |first2=Gloria M. |last2=Slaughter |publisher=Seaside Publishing |year=1984 |isbn=0942084195}}</ref> Other US stations that adopted the morning zoo program in the early-to-mid-1980s include [[KKBQ|KKBQ-FM]] in Houston in 1982, [[WRVQ]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], in April 1983,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwB6LQrNdtUC&pg=PA77 |page=77 |title=The Cash Cage |last=Deitz |first=Corey |publisher=Lessons from Camp |year=2004 |isbn=1591135370}}</ref> [[WNIC]] with the "Harper & Gannon" show<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/136774/80s-morning-co-host-steve-gannon-passes|title='80s Morning Co-Host Steve Gannon Passes|website=All Access|language=en|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> by early 1983,<ref>{{Citation|title=1983 WNIC Detroit Commerical [sic]: Harper & Gannon|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55L_JO2THHI|language=en|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> [[KMEL]] in San Francisco in early 1984,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5 |page=19 |last=Bornstein |first=Rollye |journal=Billboard |title=Vox Jox |date=March 9, 1985 |volume=97 |number=10 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> [[KFBG (FM)|KFMB-FM]] in [[San Diego, California]], by late 1984,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT18 |page=19 |last=Freeman |first=Kim |journal=Billboard |title=Vox Jox |date=October 13, 1984 |volume=96 |number=38 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> [[WJMN (FM)|WZOU]] in Boston by November 1984,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA20 |page=20 |last=Bornstein |first=Rollye |journal=Billboard |title=Vox Jox |date=November 10, 1984 |volume=96 |number=45 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> [[WGTZ]] "Z-93" in [[Dayton, Ohio]] in March 1985, [[WKPE-FM]] in southeast Massachusetts in early 1985,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT21 |page=22 |last=Bornstein |first=Rollye |journal=Billboard |title=Vox Jox |date=January 26, 1985 |volume=97 |number=4 |issn=0006-2510 }}</ref> [[WKRQ]] "Q102" and [[WEBN]]'s ''Dawn Patrol'' in Cincinnati by October 1985,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24 |page=24 |title=Cincinnati's Wake-Up Call |last=DiLonardo |first=Mary Jo |date=October 1985 |journal=Cincinnati Magazine |volume=19 |number=1 |issn=0746-8210}}</ref> and [[WNVZ]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] in September 1985.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT13 |page=14 |last=Freeman |first=Kim |journal=Billboard |title=Vox Jox |date=September 28, 1985 |volume=97 |number=38 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

==Shows==
In Australia, the morning zoo format was heard on [[Triple M]] as ''[[The Cage (radio show)|The Cage]]'', amongst other stations, including [[SAFM]] in [[Adelaide]], whose version of the morning zoo was the highest rating breakfast show there between 1985 and 1990.

The [[Don and Mike]] show originated as a morning zoo show at [[WAVA-FM]] in the 1980s, and retained some elements of the format.

In [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], LG73 (call sign [[CHMJ|CKLG]]) adopted this format for its popular morning program, led by Dean Hill, from 1985 to 1993.

In Quebec City, CJMF-FM 93.3 had ''Le Zoo du 93'' from 1985 to 1990. Not only does the show still hold a number of records in terms of ratings and market shares (a quarter-hour of 148,000 listeners), but it also skyrocketed the station to now unreachable numbers, with 573,200 listeners on a weekly basis (according to the BBM summer 1987 survey).

[[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] introduced the format to the UK when in 1981 he started his ''[[Steve Wright in the Afternoon]]'' show on [[BBC Radio 1]] which featured his "posse" of co-presenters and features.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/wright/biography_steve.shtml |publisher=BBC Radio 2 |title=Steve Wright in the Afternoon: Steve Wright}}</ref> [[Chris Moyles]] and "Comedy" [[Dave Vitty]] also used the zoo format with great success. Their audience was measured at eight million listeners by [[RAJAR]], and [[Simon Mayo]] also revolutionized British radio by introducing the format when on 23 May 1988 he took over ''[[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show]]'' from  [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] which also featured co-presenters including news anchor Rod McKenzie and three sidekick weather and travel girls, including Carol Dooley, [[Sybil Ruscoe]], [[Jackie Brambles]] and [[Dianne Oxberry]], and the show's producer [[Ric Blaxill]] who made regular speaking contributions. The programme also became known for various features, including [[On This Day In History]], the long-running cryptic game ''[[The Identik-Hit Quiz]]'', where Mayo and his co hosts would 'act' a short scene which cryptically led listeners to the title of a hit song, and also his ''[[Confessions (radio)|Confessions]]'' feature where members of the public sought absolution for their (often frivolous or humorous) "sins".

The format is used on stations of many different genres. Even [[Christian radio]] stations such as [[WAWZ]] in New Jersey have a morning zoo.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Segal |title=Christian Radio Gets Closer to the Morning-Madness Crowd |date=May 14, 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/14/AR2007031402465.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=July 15, 2007}}</ref>
