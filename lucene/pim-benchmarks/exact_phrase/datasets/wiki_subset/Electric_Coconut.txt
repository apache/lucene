'''Electric Coconut''' (aka Elektrik Cokernut) were an English [[Moog Music|Moog]] band who formed in [[Surrey]] in the 1970s. The group consisted of Len Hunter and Bill Wellings<ref>{{cite web|last=Rateyourmusic |title=Electric coconut |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/electric_coconut |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714024022/http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/electric_coconut |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2012 |publisher=Rateyourmusic |accessdate=11 March 2011 }}</ref> of BWD Productions.

Bill Wellings, an Australian former catalogue model, had pioneered the anonymous pop cover versions concept with the ''Top Six'' EPs in the mid-60s, a series that gave a big break to a young arranger named [[Johnny Harris (musician)|Johnny Harris]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thames|first=Lord|title=BWD Productions|url=http://www.verygoodplus.co.uk/showthread.php?t=900|publisher=Verygoodplus|accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref>

Wellings formed BWD in the late 1960s and did an exclusive deal with [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]] (MFP)&nbsp;â€“&#32;the first 'Hits' LP, ''Hits 67'', came out some time later. It was widely rumoured that this LP featured [[David Bowie]] singing on the track "[[Penny Lane]]", but it was actually session singer Tony Steven. ''Hits 70'' did feature [[Elton John]].

The first ''Hot Hits'' LP came in 1970 and features versions of 'Vehicle' and "[[Groovin' With Mr Bloe]]"; the latter played by [[Larry Adler]]. ''Hot Hits Vol. 2'' features [[Blue Mink]]'s [[Barry Morgan (musician)|Barry Morgan]] on drums, as does ''Vol 4''.

Among the music directors regularly used by BWD Productions were [[Alan Moorhouse]], Johnny Harris, [[Johnny Howard]] and [[Len Hunter]].

BWD was based in [[Guildford]]. Bill Wellings is deceased and the BWD catalogue is now in the hands of his wife. BWD also recorded for the Contour label using the name 'Cherry Orchard Productions'; ''Swing Gently with Strauss'' was one of their releases.
