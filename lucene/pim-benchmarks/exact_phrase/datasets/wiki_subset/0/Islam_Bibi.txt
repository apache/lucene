Bibi joined the police force in 2003 and quickly moved to the position of second [[lieutenant]] reporting directly to CID leadership which was an extraordinary achievement. She was the highest-ranking policewoman at that time and received many death threats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308163341/http://www.afghan-bios.info/index.php?option=com_afghanbios&id=2940&task=view&total=4252&start=1184&Itemid=2|title=Database|date=2020-03-08|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> She led one of the largest police female squadrons in Afghanistan that chases after the Taliban, searching for costumed suicide bombers in burqas. They were first to break into any house during a search in women's areas where male police officers are not allowed.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Crilly|first=Zubair Babakarkhail, Kabul, and Rob|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/10159122/Helmands-top-female-police-officer-shot-dead.html|title=Helmand's top female police officer shot dead|date=2013-07-04|access-date=2020-04-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> As police officers, they cover their faces with black scarves, wear thick boots, and in some cases choose to wear men's uniforms. Human Rights Watch says that female police officers often experience sexual harassment and verbal abuse by their male counterparts, in part because they lack even basic facilities. There are very few female restrooms at all police stations in Afghanistan, and women who use men's restrooms are highly vulnerable to harassment.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Graham-Harrison|first=Emma|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/04/helmand-female-police-officer-dead-islam-bibi|title=Helmand's top female police officer shot dead|date=2013-07-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
