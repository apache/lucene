'''Matthew "Matt" Watson''' (born February 5, 1996) is an American [[YouTuber]], comedian, video editor and music artist. He hosts the variety comedy channel SuperMega along with his friend and longtime colleague Ryan Magee. He, along with Magee, are former editors of the YouTube channels [[Markiplier]] and [[Game Grumps]]. Watson also co-owns the channel Kids w/ Problems, and was a member of sketch comedy group Cyndago before it was disbanded.

==Personal life==
Watson was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. He is the son of Dale and Anne Watson and the younger brother of Samantha.

He attended the [[University of South Carolina]], dropping out in 2015 to join the YouTube channel Cyndago with Ryan Magee and Daniel Kyre.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Matt Watson|url=https://gamegrumps.fandom.com/wiki/Matt_Watson|website=Game Grumps Wiki|language=en|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref>

==YouTube career==
On January 5, 2008, Watson created a YouTube channel under the name "formatt24."<ref>{{Cite web|title=formatt24|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHNLfloDHgahgYcP2FNIBw|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref> The channel has been apparently unused since 2011.

In 2014, Watson began posting to a sketch comedy channel, Kids w/ Problems, with his friend and classmate Jackson Tucker. Magee would later join the two after Cyndago disbanded.

Watson began working for [[Markiplier]] as an editor in mid-2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MEET MATT THE NEW EDITOR!!|url=https://markiplier.fandom.com/wiki/MEET_MATT_THE_NEW_EDITOR!!|website=Markiplier Wiki|language=en|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref> He left about a year later, confirming it in a [[Twitter|Tweet]] on July 21, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yes, as he's said in ...|url=https://twitter.com/matthwatson/status/756070913536200705|last=Matt|date=2016-07-21|website=@matthwatson|language=en|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref>

Sometime in early 2016, Watson was hired along with Magee as an editor for the comedy gaming channel [[Game Grumps]]. Their employment was unknown until co-host [[Arin Hanson]] confirmed it in an episode released on September 11.<ref>{{Citation|title=Katamari Forever: The Snowball Effect - PART 26 - Game Grumps|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UR_QZHfFvQ|language=en|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref>
