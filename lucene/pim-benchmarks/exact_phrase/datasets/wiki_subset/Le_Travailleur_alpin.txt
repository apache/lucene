''Le Travailleur alpin'' was closed down by the Communist Party in 1948, in order to save the pro-communist newspaper ''Allobroges'' instead. Some staff, who had worked for both newspapers, were able to retain their employments.<ref>Martin, Marc. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mBUZP_N59Q0C Médias et journalistes de la République]''. Histoires, hommes, entreprises. Paris: Odile Jacob, 1997, p. 305.</ref>

The Communist Party organized a ''Fête du Travailleur alpin'' press festival annually, a tradition initiated in 1929 and that continued after the end of the publication of the daily newspaper.<ref>https://www.humanite.fr/2003-06-21_Politique_-Balises-Le-Travailleur-alpin</ref>
