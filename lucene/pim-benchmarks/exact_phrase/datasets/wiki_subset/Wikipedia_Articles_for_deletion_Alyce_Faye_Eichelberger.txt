Former wife of [[John Cleese]]. The article seems to have a recurrent issue with COI edits by what appears to be a PR person (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alyce_Faye_Eichelberger&diff=224206037&oldid=223633332], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alyce_Faye_Eichelberger&diff=221765494&oldid=212432003], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alyce_Faye_Eichelberger&diff=221765494&oldid=212432003], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alyce_Faye_Eichelberger&diff=prev&oldid=261324841], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alyce_Faye_Eichelberger&diff=prev&oldid=267467538]). Without the Cleese connection, it is highly unlikely that this person would be considered notable. As [[WP:NOTABILITY]] notes, notability does not transfer from Cleese to former (or current) wives and girlfriends. The subject of the bio seems to dislike some of the statements made in regard to her (despite appearing in reliable sources) - I propose deletion of this bio as a solution.

*'''Delete'''  Subject has written a non-notable book, married a notable person and attended the same school as another notable person, none of which makes them notable. [[User:Edward321|Edward321]] ([[User talk:Edward321|talk]]) 01:15, 6 February 2009 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I've made an alteration to the article. The subject is in fact the co-author of the book, which is actually quite a notable publication. The other author is [[Brian Bates]] who has a fair list of publications. (Oddly enough, he has subsequently written a book with John Cleese.) Whether her part in the co-authoring is notable, I can't say. Her name appears above his on the cover and in many references.

*'''Weak keep''' I hate to say, keep only if sourced, but this would be one of the times. I am reasonably sure she is notable on her own right as a therapist. I'm also sure the article doesnt give evidence for it--there's a source for an award, and but the only other sourced content is a very dubious bit of 2nd hand gossip unrelated to her individual notability.  The article was written around the wrong premise about notability, but that can be fixed.  '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG|talk]]) 04:51, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
**"Keep if sourced" is not a valid !vote. A Google news search for '''''"Alyce Faye Eichelberger" -Cleese''''' returns all of 2 results, one in German and one which actually is about Cleese. If she were a notable psychologist there should be eveidence of this. Can someone close this already?

::::DC,  the part in bold. That's the !vote. The comment is supplementary, for discussion & explanation.. '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG|talk]]) 05:10, 16 February 2009 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' sources show the subject meets the GNG. RMHED[[Special:Contributions/RMHED|<font color="black">.</font>]] 18:53, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': [[WP:RS|reliable source coverage]] satisfies [[WP:N#General notability guideline|the general notability guideline]], even discounting news coverage of her marriage to [[John Cleese]].  Career notable enough to win induction into Oklahoma State's Educational Hall of Fame, thus satisfies [[WP:BIO]] even if more sources discussing her career are not added to the article.  She doesn't earn inherited notability from her marriage to Cleese, but it shouldn't count against her either.  I think if we had a candidate unrelated to Cleese who studied under Anna Freud, wrote a notable book and was inducted to a university hall of fame, the article would be kept, indeed probably wouldn't be nominated for AfD in the first place.

**I can't agree that induction into "Oklahoma State's Educational Hall of Fame" counts for anything at all toward notability outside the boundaries of OSU. I nominated this because the subject appears to have issues with some of the properly sourced information in the article and removing the article seems like the only way to satisfy that desire. Odd to see some of the keep !votes here from editors who are generally sympathetic to BLP issues, but whatever...
