'''Across Five Aprils''' (often shortened to '''A5A''') was a [[post-hardcore]] band from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The band started in September 2001 and were signed to [[Victory Records]]. Their name was borrowed from the late [[Irene Hunt]] Novel about the [[American Civil War]]. The band broke up in late 2008.

==History==

===Formation, ''A Tragedy in Progress'' and ''Collapse'' (2001&ndash;2007)===
The band released its first album, ''A Tragedy in Progress'', in May 2003 on Indianola Records. Following the success of this release, they played shows with bands such as [[Underoath]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]], [[Haste the Day]], [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]] and [[It Dies Today]]. Not long after the release, original guitarist Jason Fields departed the band.

After some member changes, the band wrote and recorded their second release on Indianola, an EP entitled ''[[Living in the Moment (Across Five Aprils EP)|Living in the Moment]]''. Shortly after the release of the [[Extended play|EP]], [[frontman]] Steve Taylor left the band and they picked up new frontman Brandon Mullins. Following Taylor's departure, bassist Jason Barry departed also. They toured the United States several times with bands such as [[The Banner (band)|The Banner]], and then proceeded to write their second full-length release, ''[[Collapse (Across Five Aprils album)|Collapse]]''. Following the release of this album, the band went back on the road full-time and in July 2007, the band was picked up by [[Victory Records]]. At this point, Drew Miller has also departed the band, leaving Zak Towe the only original founding member in the band. Before entering the studio to record their third album, guitarist Jarrod Smith has also left the band, and was replaced by Adam Nordmeyer.

===''Life Underwater'' and frequent line-up changes (2007&ndash;2008)===

Across Five Aprils released their [[Victory Records]] debut album, ''Life Underwater'', on February 19, 2008.  The album was recorded by producer Matt Goldman from Glow in the Dark Studios in Atlanta, Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoryrecords.com/news|title=Victory Records News|accessdate=2007-10-22|publisher=victory records|year=2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055629/http://www.victoryrecords.com/news| archivedate= 19 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

===Break up (2008)===
On September 22, 2008, Across Five Aprils announced that they would be breaking up. They had a very short farewell tour in October and had their final farewell show in Chattanooga, TN on November 1, 2008.

===Reunion and A Tragedy in Progress (2010)===
On October 14, 2010, the original line-up of Across Five Aprils announced two reunion shows in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] and [[Marietta, Georgia]]. The band used the moniker [[A Tragedy in Progress (band)|A Tragedy in Progress]] as an homage from the debut album out of respect to the members that came after them, and decided not to use the original band name. They released a four song EP titled ''[[Going Down with the Ship]]'' on [[Indianola Records]] on January 25, 2011, on their original label [[Indianola Records]]. The EP included a re-recording of the song "Around the World in a Radio Flyer" (titled only "Radio Flyer") from their classic debut album.

===2012 Reunion (2012)===
On March 31, 2012, the band played a one-off reunion show in [[Pensacola, Florida]]. The first reunion show of the band under that name, as the 2010 shows were performed by the band under A Tragedy in Progress, which became a new band. The band members performing were not the original line-up but instead the line-up of the band's second album ''[[Collapse (Across Five Aprils album)|Collapse]]'', unlike the 2010 reunion which focused on the ''[[A Tragedy in Progress (album)|Tragedy in Progress]]'' line-up. The line-up included Drew Miller and Zak Towe (from A Tragedy in Progress), Brandon Mullins, Jarrod Smith and Josh Dycus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/atragedyinprogress/posts/352989514737301|title=A Tragedy In Progress|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=7 December 2018}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}}
