The '''Assyrian Confederation of Europe (ACE)''' is a European umbrella organisation for Assyrian national federations and organisations in Europe.  It was formed on 22 April 2016 in Brussels, Belgium.<ref>http://aina.org/news/20160425173437.htm AINA News, ''Assyrian Confederation of Europe established in Brussels'', 25 April 2016</ref> The Brussels office was opened in April 2018.<ref>http://www.assyriatv.org/2018/04/opening-ceremony-assyrian-confederation-europe-office-brussels/ Assyria TV, ''Opening ceremony of ACE office in Brussels'', 15 April 2018</ref>  ACE works to connect and represent half a million Europeans of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] descent.

==History==

Assyrian communities have been present in Europe since the 1920s. After the [[Assyrian genocide|genocide]] of 1915 in then [[Ottoman Turkey]] and in search for safer place to live, some Assyrians fled to Europe, in southern France ([[Marseille]] and [[Toulouse]]).<ref>ABOONA Hirmiz, ''Assyrians, Kurds and Ottomans. Intercommunal Relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire'', Cambria Press, 2008.</ref>  <br> 
The exodus from their land of origin, known historically as [[Assyria]], has not stopped since then. It has even accelerated in recent years due to the general turmoil in the [[Middle East]] with all the risks it implies (kidnappings, ethnic cleansing and targeted killings).<ref>APRIM Frederick A., ''Assyrians: The Continuous Saga'', Xlibris, 2005.</ref>

The longstanding idea of setting up a pan-European umbrella for Assyrian organisations was materialised in 2016. The establishment of ACE was formally announced in the [[European Parliament|European parliament]] in [[Brussels]] on 22 April.

The organization is the European counterpart of the [[United States]]-based [[Assyrian Policy Institute]], with whom the ACE regularly cooperates.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Start för Assyrian Policy Institute i Washington|url=https://hujada.nu/start-for-assyrian-policy-institute-i-washington/|date=2018-05-28|website=Hujådå|language=sv-SE|access-date=September 12, 2020}}</ref>

==Aims==

ACE is mainly dedicated to three aims:
* Promotion of Assyrian identity and [[Assyrian culture|culture]] in Europe
* Representation of Assyrians of Europe in politics and media
* Support for efforts in [[Assyrian homeland|Assyria]] for democracy and equal rights
