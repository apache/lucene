==Distribution and habitat==
This beetle may have originated in Central Asia, but is now widely distributed, being found in Russia, China, parts of the Middle East, Europe, Central America, North America and Oceania.<ref name=urban/><ref name=itis/><ref name=gbif/> It is an [[Economic entomology|economic pest]] in a range of dry goods including animal foods, wheat and barley kernels, wholemeal flour, corn meal, oat meal, noodles and other cereal-based foodstuffs. It also infests animal detritus, fish meal, spices, nuts, cocoa and sugar products.<ref name=urban/> In the indoor environment it occurs in warehouses, granaries, food stores and dwellings, and outdoors in Russia, it has been found in bee nests.<ref name=buglink/>

==Life cycle==
Eggs are laid in suitable dry materials, and if kept in the temperature range {{convert|20|to|38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, hatch in about a week. There are normally six [[instar]]s, and some mature larvae enter an active [[diapause]], especially in cooler habitats, and may remain in the larval state for two years.<ref name=urban/> Non-diapausing larvae [[pupa]]te near the surface of the foodstuff about seven weeks after the eggs were laid; the pupation period lasts about four days, and the new adults rest for two to seven days before emerging from the last larval skin.<ref name=urban/> Longevity for males is nine days at {{convert|40|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} and several weeks under cooler conditions. Females also live longer at lower temperatures.<ref name=urban/>
