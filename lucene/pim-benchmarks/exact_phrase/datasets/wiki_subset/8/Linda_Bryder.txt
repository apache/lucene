In 2008 she was appointed professor at the [[University of Auckland]].<ref name="bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/people/lbry008 |title=Professor Linda Bryder - The University of Auckland |website=www.arts.auckland.ac.nz}}</ref><ref name="bio2">{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-staff/meet-our-staff/linda-bryder.html |title=Professor Linda Bryder - The University of Auckland |website=www.arts.auckland.ac.nz}}</ref>

==Academic career==
After completing a [[Master of Arts|MA(Hons)]] at the [[University of Auckland]], and a 1985 [[DPhil]] thesis on the social history of [[tuberculosis]] in Britain, at the [[University of Oxford]], Bryder returned to Auckland, where she continued her research into the social history of medicine.<ref name="bio"/><ref name="bio2"/><ref name="Royal Society">{{cite web |url=https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/who-we-are/our-people/our-fellows/all-fellows/a-c/ |title=List of all Fellows with surnames A–C |publisher=Royal Society of New Zealand |accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>
 
Bryder's highest profile work has been in relation to the [[Cartwright Inquiry]] into the 'unfortunate experiment'. Her 2009 book ''A History of the 'Unfortunate Experiment' at National Women's Hospital'' did not support one of the inquiry's central findings (that there had been a prospective study) and attracted a great deal of attention in academia<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carrell|first=Robin W. |date=2012|title=Trial By Media|journal=Notes and Records: The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2012.0028 |s2cid=162560322 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2010/vol-123-no-1308/review-heslop |title=A History of the 'Unfortunate Experiment' at National Women's Hospital (Linda Bryder) |journal=New Zealand Medical Journal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2010/vol-123-no-1311/letter-overton |title=In defence of Linda Bryder's book A History of the 'Unfortunate Experiment' at National Women's Hospital |journal=New Zealand Medical Journal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2010/vol-123-no-1309/letter-jones |title=National Women's Hospital deserves a fair and balanced history—with response by Linda Bryder |journal=New Zealand Medical Journal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/profs-join-stand-against-criticism-cartwright-inquiry |title=Profs join stand against criticism of Cartwright Inquiry |date=25 January 2010 |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://skeptics.nz/journal/issues/98/orthodoxy-restated |title=Orthodoxy Restated |date=31 January 2011 |publisher=}}</ref> and in the popular press.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10659376 |title=No accounting for mistakes |first=Chris |last=Barton |date=16 July 2010 |publisher= |via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10598213 |title=An unfortunate fallout: Academics against Bryder's revisionist history |first=Chris |last=Barton |date=18 September 2009 |publisher= |via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2029333/linda-bryder-unfortunate-experiment-revisited |title=Linda Bryder: unfortunate experiment revisited |date=17 March 2011 |publisher=}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartwrightinquiry.com/?page_id=95 |title=Recent Controversy concerning Professor Linda Bryder's Historical Revisionism - Cartwright Inquiry |website=www.cartwrightinquiry.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/2010/08/19/professor-linda-bryder-responses-to-a-history-of-the-unfortunate-experiment/ |title=Professor Linda Bryder: Responses to 'A History of the "Unfortunate Experiment"' |date=19 August 2010 |publisher=}}</ref><ref>https://www.womenshealthcouncil.org.nz/Features/Cartwright+Inquiry.html</ref> In 2010 she was invited to write an editorial in the ''New Zealand Journal of History'' on her research,<ref>{{Citation|last=Bryder|first=Linda|title=Conclusion: An 'Unfortunate Experiment'?|date=2010|work=Women’s Bodies and Medical Science|pages=197–201|place=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |doi=10.1007/978-0-230-25110-6_12|isbn=978-1-349-58915-9}}</ref> and in 2018 she published a letter in the ''New Zealand Medical Journal'' drawing on new relevant international research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bryder|first=Linda|date=2018|title=Letter: Primum non nocere: First do no harm.|url=https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/42490?show=full|journal=New Zealand Medical Journal|volume=131|issue=1475|pages=81–83|via=Research Space}}</ref> In 2019 and 2020 studies were published in Britain validating her original findings.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Raffle|first1=AE|title=Screening: Evidence and Practice|last2=Mackie|first2=A|last3=Gray|first3=JAM |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|location=Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Knottnerus|first1=J.
