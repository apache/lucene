==Plot==
Jeeva (Hemanth Kumar) is an auditor who handles the finances of the popular cinema actress Kiran ([[Kiran Rathod]]). He is madly in love with her. Jeeva's best friend Jinda (V. Rishiraj) is the most notorious gangster of [[Chennai]]. On one hand, he is a cold-blooded and dangerous person for his enemies, and on the other hand, he is a kindhearted person for his family and friends. He is married and has a kid. When Jeeva had to leave his village after an argument with his father, Jinda hosted his friend in his home and helped Jeeva financially. Jeeva became an auditor and started to work for the popular actress Kiran. They got close and eventually fell in love with each other. Kiran wants him to keep their love a secret because of her celebrity status. Thereafter, Jinda is shocked to discover his friend being in love with Kiran. He advises Jeeva to forget Kiran, but Jeeva refuses to listen to his friend. Jinda then reveals that he had enjoyed Kiran's sexual favours on several occasions. Jeeva is shocked at the news, so he compels Kiran to explain about his friend's accusation. Finally, Kiran admits that she had several [[casting couch]] experiences with producers and had to sleep with influential bigwigs like Jinda for her own benefit. During the initial stages of her acting career, she struggled a lot to shake off key roles, therefore to attain a top position in the industry, she made some compromises on the personal front. Kiran then confesses that she does not believe in love and that money is the most important thing in life for her. Unable to bear this bitter truth, Jeeva, who was sincerely in love with Kiran, drowns his sorrow in liquor. Being duped for too long by the greedy and opportunist Kiran, Jeeva decides to abduct her. Jinda tracks down Jeeva, and he stops Jeeva killing Kiran. Jinda tells Kiran that she is immoral and a disgrace to humanity, then he chokes her to death right in front of Jeeva.
