== Help with Russian, Turkish, and Arabic==
How do I say "Schools in Paris" and "Secondary/High schools in Paris" in:
* Russian
* Arabic
* Turkish

I want to add those names to [[:Commons:Category:Schools in Paris]] and [[:Commons:Category:Sixth form colleges in Paris]]

Thanks

:<s>Why do you want to add those names to those categories? If the Russian, Arabic, and Turkish Wikipedias have corresponding categories, their names will be decided by editors at those Wikipedias, and then interlanguage links to them will be added by either editors or bots. And if those Wikipedias don't have corresponding categories, there's no need for our categories to list the foreign phrases.

== Pretest Probablity and Statistics ==

The term is "pretest probablity". It is used to determine what is the probable cause of a disease or the cause of patient's symptoms. In which possible way can the term "pretest probablity" be related to the field of "statistics". To put it straight, In which possible way can "pretest probablity" be related to the studies of Statistics i.e. for example pretest probablity with respect to sampling?

== "There", "they're", "their" confusion. ==

The phenomenon of "there" taking over the role of its homophones "they're" and "their" seems to be spreading across the globe, like a particularly virulent cancer, in the last decade or so. Is there any scholarly research out there to explain the how and why of it? 
Another one that gets up my nose is "then" replacing "than". 
It seems as if an entire generation of illiterate, allegedly English speaking people has suddenly appeared out of thin air and spread over the entire English speaking world. 
Just to declare my "systemic biases": I'm a 43 year old, white, male, native speaker of South African English. [[User:Dodger67|Roger]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 16:32, 7 March 2011 (UTC)
:It's all the fault of the generalization of [[literacy]]. Back in the good old days when only 1% of the population knew how to read and write at all, you could be tolerably sure they all did it correctly. Of course they also had the advantage that spelling wasn't standardized yet, so nothing they wrote was really wrong. But nowadays, we have spellings set in stone by dictionaries, and schools trying to teach ''every'' Tom, Dick, and Harry to read and write: there's no hope that every written shopping list or kitchen-table note is going to be perfectly spelled and punctuated. [[User:Pais|Pais]] ([[User talk:Pais|talk]]) 16:39, 7 March 2011 (UTC)

:Spelling doesn't necessarily reflect English proficiency. The fact that someone doesn't know how to spell some words in Standard English doesn't mean s/he is not "English speaking". Granted, it's annoying, and it's something you don't want to see on CV or some other formal context; it doesn't, however, mean that the person is not a user of real English, just that the person's English is not the same as what we were taught is the "correct" English. For what it's worth, your usage of commas is also incorrect in every national variety of English I am aware of (should be "43-year-old white male native speaker of South African English"), but that doesn't mean your English is somehow less English than mine. <b class="IPA">[[Special:Contributions/Rjanag|r<font color="#8B0000">ʨ</font>anaɢ]]</b>&nbsp;([[User talk:Rjanag|talk]]) 16:49, 7 March 2011 (UTC)

::: So, how come it's the responsibility of ''other people'' to have to work out what the writer is saying, just because the writer is too lazy or whatever to find the commonly accepted form of expression or spelling to reflect what ''they'' are thinking?  "Good enough" is not considered good enough anywhere else, and rightly so.  Imagine a surgeon's response to your family's criticism after he removed your brain instead of your tonsils: "Oh but you know what I meant to remove, so go away and stop being all anal about it".  Or you board a flight to New York but you get put off in Los Angeles:  "Well, you're at least in the right country so stop nitpicking".  Look, I agree that getting all picky can be a colossal bore, to say the least, and there should always be room for human creativity.  But this isn't about being creative.  It's about people not giving a fuck, and dumping a load of trouble on others.  Is that OK?  Not in my books.  It's also about people not taking any pride in their own work.  They'll strive and struggle and aim to achieve and seek to improve themselves in every other way, but when it comes to this subject, they completely drop the ball.  Somewhere along the way, during their education or childhood, they were given the message that it's OK not to have high standards in this single field of human activity, but everywhere else, such high standards are mandatory.

::::::Jack, I suspect if we knew clearly the answer to your question (i.e. why's it OK not to care about clear expression), the field of pedagogy would be in much better shape than it is today.  There's some extent to which "proper" language (and perhaps even spelling) is seen as the purview of prissy, effete rich people who are so out of touch with regular (read: "real") people that disregarding standards of spelling and grammar is a prerequisite to any sort of hipness or cred. Despite Sputnik and the Internet, we still live in a world in which taking open pride in intellectual achievement is for losers, commies, and elitists (while sometimes the achievement itself is tolerated or even sought).

I have found for the past decade or so that I can spell English better than many native speakers, even though I learned English as an entirely foreign language. But then again, my English pronunciation is horrible compared to native speakers. I don't know how to stress syllables properly, some consonant sounds (particularly "th") completely elude me, and I have a hard time distinguishing between things like "ch" in one word and "ch" in another, or the soft "g" and the soft "j", which native English speakers find self-evident. The reason for this must be that Finnish spelling is almost entirely phonetic, with a good correspondence between spoken phonemes and written glyphs, whereas in English it's much more complicated, there is a huge amount of different sounds expressed with a small alphabet, and the mapping between spoken and written language is very complicated, and nowhere near bijective.

:My impression is that while a there/their/they're confusion is not uncommon, it's not nearly as widespread as misuse of I/me/myself, which has reached epidemic proportions. I hear "between you and I" at least weekly on television, from writer's pens to actors lips, and I feel physical pain each time. The strangest part of this is that it seems it is part of an over-correction backlash. About 15 years ago many people became aware of the misuse of "me" when "I" was proper and there was something of a campaign to fix this. The result is not ideal. Now everyone avoids "me" in any sentence involving more than one person, using "I" instead, and where the native ear recognizes "I" as clearly wrong, "myself" gets shoehorned in. At least three times over the past five years or so when I have said "between you and me" someone has attempted to ''correct me''!

::::I've noticed exactly the same tendency to over-use "I" when "me" is the correct personal pronoun, even from educated speakers on BBC Radio 4.  The recent change is the over-correction.  I can remember when it was much more common to hear "me" used instead of "I".  The worst example of the modern trend, heard a few years ago from a deputy head in a secondary school, was "Sheila's and I's".

:I also get annoyed by people who don't use the proper spelling.  I should probably question my motivation, though.  Am I just annoyed because I needed to learn the distinction, and they don't care ?  I suppose I could argue that the different spellings help us to avoid ambiguous sentences, but the question comes up as to whether (or should I say weather ? :-) ) the cost of learning the different spellings of homophones justifies the benefit.  I do feel that having all words spelled phonetically would make literacy far simpler, and that's a worthy goal. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 21:44, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

::<small> Stu, you mean the annoyance caused by people insisting on spelling the possessive pronoun "its" as "it's" (which means "it is" or "it has")?

:::<small>Yes, I also see no point in following bizarre grammar rules that make artificial distinctions between how possessives are used for proper nouns versus pronouns.  It's similar to how I feel about other languages that consider inanimate objects either masculine or feminine.  Some such rules seem almost designed to prevent the masses from attaining literacy.

::::<small>Hmm, the distinction is not ''quite'' artificial. The possessives of the personal pronouns ("its", "his") don't work in exactly the same way as the "[[Saxon genitive]]" (*it's, *he's). You say "I saw its cover" with reference to a book, but you normally don't say "I saw the book's cover" - rather, you say "I saw the cover of the book" (but not "the cover of it").--[[Special:Contributions/91.148.159.4|91.148.159.4]] ([[User talk:91.148.159.4|talk]]) 17:19, 9 March 2011 (UTC)</small>
