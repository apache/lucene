The '''“European Local Democracy Week”''' is an annual event with national and local events organised by participating local authorities in all [[Council of Europe]] member States. The purpose is to foster the knowledge of local democracy and promote the idea of democratic participation at a local level. While the week is overseen by the Council of Europe, it is each local and regional community which organizes events centered on the selected theme.

== Background ==
The week of October 15 is chosen every year for European Local Democracy Week as the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]] was opened for signature by member states on that date in 1985 and the date is considered symbolic for European Local Democracy. In recognition of the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the Conference of Local and Regional Authorities (the predecessor to today's [[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe|Congress of Local and Regional Authorities]], the first European Local Democracy Week took place in 2007.

Each year has had a unique and relevant theme for each community to work with which are very important on the local level with past themes including the issue of Sustainability on the local level. The theme for the European Local Democracy Week in 2011 was human rights at the local level. While the themes are universal for all of the local and regional communities, each community can interpret the theme is a manner that is more relevant to their specific needs. Events and activities organized can include poster campaigns, interactive websites, public meetings, exchanges, Open Days or specifically targeted events for different groups of people like children.

The leading theme in 2012 was human rights make for more inclusive communities. In 2012, some 150 partners from 29 countries joined the ELDW. For the first time, municipalities in Morocco and Tunisia also registered as ELDW partners, in order to strengthen local democracy.  A total of 342 activities and events were organised by towns, cities, regions, national and international associations. Motivating citizens to take part in decision-making processes at the grassroots level will be at the center of the 2013 edition of the European Local Democracy Week, under the leading theme “active citizenship:  voting, sharing, participating”. This theme has been endorsed by the new ELDW Political Co-ordinator, Congress Vice-President and  member of the Municipal Council of Dubrovnik (Croatia),  Dubravka Suica, further to a co-ordination meeting assembling  representatives of European cities, regions and associations.

Since 2013, the [[European Parliament]] has held an entirely separate event for members of national parliaments under the name "European Parliamentary Week".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/relnatparl/en/conferences/european-parliamentary-week.html|title=European Parliamentary Week|website=European Parliament|access-date=15 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Hefftler|editor1-first=Claudia|editor2-last=Neuhold|editor2-first=Christine|editor3-last=Rozenberg|editor3-first=Olivier|editor4-last=Smith|editor4-first=Julie|title=The Palgrave Handbook of National Parliaments and the European Union|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137289131|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqyYBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA99}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=European Parliamentary Week: MPs in Brussels to debate economy, jobs and budget|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160212IPR14103/European-Parliamentary-Week-MPs-in-Brussels-to-debate-economy-jobs-and-budget|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>
