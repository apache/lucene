Please make sure that changes to this page conform to changes in all pages in the series. -->Following is a list of current and former [[courthouse]]s of the [[United States federal court]] system located in [[Massachusetts]]. Each entry indicates the name of the building along with an image, if available, its location and the jurisdiction it covers,<ref name="j">For the usage of court abbreviations, see [[List of United States district and territorial courts]].</ref> the dates during which it was used for each such jurisdiction, and, if applicable the person for whom it was named, and the date of renaming. Dates of use will not necessarily correspond with the dates of construction or demolition of a building, as pre-existing structures may be adapted for court use, and former court buildings may later be put to other uses.
