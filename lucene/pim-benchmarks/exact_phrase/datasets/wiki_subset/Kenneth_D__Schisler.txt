'''Kenneth D. Schisler''' (born July 31, 1969) is a former member of the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] and former chair of the [[Maryland Public Service Commission]].

==Background==
Schisler was first elected to office in 1990 when he was only 21 years old. He was elected to represent District 37, which covered [[Caroline County, MD|Caroline]], [[Dorchester County, MD|Dorchester]], [[Talbot County, MD|Talbot]], and [[Wicomico County|Wicomico]] counties. He was elected along with three [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] - Don William Bradley, Samuel Q. Johnson III, and Robert A. Thornton, Jr.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1990/results_1990/gahod.html Maryland State Board of Elections<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He replaced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Richard F. Colburn]], who eventually returned to the General Assembly in 1995 as a State Senator.

In 1994, District 37 was divided into 37A (Dorchester and Wicomico Counties) and District 37B (Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, and Wicomico Counties). In this reconfigured district, Schisler won reelection along with fellow Republican [[Adelaide C. Eckardt]], one of the candidates he defeated in 1990.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1994/results_1994/gahod.html Maryland State Board of Elections<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Schisler and Eckardt defeated Democratic incumbent Robert Thornton, Jr. and challenger Philip Carey Foster.<ref>[http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/05sen/html/msa12161.html Richard F. Colburn, Maryland State Senator<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1998, Schisler and Eckardt again won reelection, this time defeating Democratic challenger William Steven Brohawn.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/gahod.html Maryland State Board of Elections<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The next general election in 2002 had similar results, except there was no formal Democratic challenger.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2002/results/g_house_of_delegate.html Maryland State Board of Elections<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Public Service Commission==
From 1997 until 1998 he served on the Task Force to Study Retail Electric Competition and the Restructuring of the Electric Utility Industry. This is relevant to the work in his next position, the chair of the [[Maryland Public Service Commission]] (PSC). Schisler was appointed to the five year position by Governor [[Bob Ehrlich]] in 2003 to succeed [[Catherine I. Riley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.md.us/psc/aboutus/Press/schislerNewChair.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922215628/http://www.psc.state.md.us/psc/aboutus/Press/schislerNewChair.htm |archivedate=2006-09-22 }}</ref>  This appointment was approved by the [[Maryland General Assembly]].

During the 2006 gubernatorial election, Schisler came under fire by the Maryland General Assembly and Democratic candidate [[Martin O'Malley]] for approving a 72% rate hike by utility provider [[Baltimore Gas & Electric]] (BGE).<ref>[http://www.gazette.net/stories/013107/polinew132330_32320.shtml]</ref>  Schisler's defended his position by stating that the rate hike was the long-term result to the deregulation plan enacted by the Maryland legislature in 1999 during the term of the previous governor, [[Parris Glendening]], and approved by the former members of the PSC. One of the members of the PSC that approved the rate cap was Joseph Curran III, the brother-in-law of Baltimore mayor and gubernatorial candidate Martin O'Malley, and son of the [[Maryland Attorney General]], [[J. Joseph Curran, Jr.|Joseph Curran]].<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-id.moore26mar26,0,4905076.column?coll=bal-home-columnists]</ref>

The 1999 plan would allow for competition for electricity in Maryland, but called for a rate cap to last until 2006, which turned out to be a rate so low that it discouraged competition. The original plan also would allow for rates to be reset at the end of the capped period, at which time the market forces would determine the going rate for electricity.

In the criticism of Schisler, O'Malley stated that the PSC was a "lapdog for special interests" and demanded that Schisler be removed from his position.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4183/is_20060314/ai_n16143941 |work=The Daily Record |title=Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley wants Public Service Comm. head |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616023351/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4183/is_20060314/ai_n16143941/ |archivedate=2011-06-16 }}</ref>    In a similar vein, [[Michael E. Busch]], the Speaker of the House for the Maryland House of Delegates, criticized the casual relationship between Schisler and Carville Collins, an industry representative who represented BGE and [[Pepco]] Electric. The Democrat's argument was that the Schisler and the rest of the appointees on the commission were too friendly with the industry and not looking out for the interest of the consumers, thus having lost their independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wjz.com/topstories/local_story_119130058.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195506/http://wjz.com/topstories/local_story_119130058.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref>

In June 2006, the Democratic-controlled Maryland General Assembly passed a law that included the removal of the current members of the PSC. Ken Schisler sued (''Kenneth D. Schisler, et al. v. State of Maryland'')<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.courts.state.md.us/opinions/coa/2006/140a05.pdf]</ref> and won the right to keep his job arguing that only the governor could fire the members of the PSC.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-te.md.psc08jul08,0,1601564.story?coll=bal-iraq-headlines%20]</ref>  The law, had it taken effect, would have allowed the General Assembly to appoint 2 members each by the [[Maryland House of Delegates|House]] and [[Maryland State Senate|Senate]] to the PSC, while only allowing the Governor to appoint one member. Currently, the appointment of members of the PSC belongs to the executive branch.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/politics/bal-politicsqa0404,0,3120728.story?coll=bal-mdpolitics-storyutil]</ref>

Martin O'Malley won the gubernatorial election in 2006, thus Schisler lost his advocate, Governor Bob Ehrlich. State Senate President [[Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr.|Mike Miller]] tried to negotiate an amicable deal which would have had Schisler removed, but Schisler turned down the offer. O'Malley's chief council, Ralph S. Tyler, said that if Schisler would not resign his position, he could be fired.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  Under pressure, Schisler eventually resigned on February 2, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.md.us/psc/aboutus/Press/ChairmanStatement_01292007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703140310/http://www.psc.state.md.us/psc/aboutus/Press/ChairmanStatement_01292007.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-03 }}</ref>  Governor Martin O'Malley appointed [[Steven Larsen]] to replace Schisler. Larsen is a former Insurance Commissioner for the Maryland Insurance Agency.<ref>[ Thomas_V._Mike_Miller%2C_Jr.]</ref>  Larsen was given a salary of $185,000, 58% more than Schisler's salary of $117,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wbal.com/news/story.asp?articleid=54403 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231538/http://wbal.com/news/story.asp?articleid=54403 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref>

The PSC approved a 15% increase that would take effect in July 2006 and be in place for 11 months.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/12/AR2006061201287.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Bill Would Stretch Rate Hike, Aid Pepco Users | first=Ann E. | last=Marimow | date=June 13, 2006 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> This was during the final months of Governor Ehrlich's term. A future increase was to be determined after the election. However, Ehrlich was defeated by Martin O'Malley. With the 11-month period nearly over, a 48% rate hike has been proposed, which when calculated along with the original 15%, is nearly identical to the originally proposed 72% rate hike from 2006.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Ironically, the new commissioners under Governor O'Malley accepted this proposal stating that there was no legal way to change these new rates.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://webapp.psc.state.md.us/Intranet/Casenum/NewIndex3_VOpenFile.cfm?ServerFilePath=C%3A%5CCaseNum%5C9000-9099%5C9099%5C096.pdf |title=CN 9099 - Final Order.PDF<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2020-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023447/http://webapp.psc.state.md.us/Intranet/Casenum/NewIndex3_VOpenFile.cfm?ServerFilePath=C:%5CCaseNum%5C9000-9099%5C9099%5C096.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
