'''Maryland Route 298''' ('''MD 298''') is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]]. The highway runs {{convert|20.14|mi|km}} from [[Maryland Route 20|MD 20]] near [[Fairlee, Maryland|Fairlee]] east to [[Maryland Route 291|MD 291]] near [[Chesterville, Maryland|Chesterville]]. MD 298 is a C-shaped highway that connects Fairlee, [[Maryland Route 213|MD 213]], and [[Millington, Maryland|Millington]] with several villages in northern [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent County]], including [[Butlertown, Maryland|Butlertown]], [[Lynch, Maryland|Lynch]], and [[Still Pond, Maryland|Still Pond]]. The highway also provides a bypass of [[Chestertown, Maryland|Chestertown]] between the western and eastern parts of the county. MD 298 was built from Fairlee to [[Maryland Route 292|MD 292]] near Still Pond around 1930 and reconstructed in the early 1950s. The highway was extended eastward to [[Maryland Route 566|MD 566]] east of Still Pond in the mid-1950s, to MD 213 in the early 1960s, and to MD 291 in the late 1980s.

==History==
The first portion of modern MD 298 to be constructed was the portion south of Fairlee, which was constructed as a concrete road as part of the Chestertown&ndash;Rock Hall road (now MD 20) in 1918.<ref name="1919 src report"/><ref name="1921 map"/> The highway proper was constructed as a concrete road from MD 20 in Fairlee to MD 292 south of Still Pond in 1929 and 1930.<ref name="1930 src report"/><ref name="1930 map"/> MD 298 from Fairlee to Butlertown was widened to {{convert|20|ft|m}} and resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1950. The widening and resurfacing continued along stretch from Butlertown to Lynch in 1951 and 1952. The construction at Lynch included smoothing the curve just east of MD 561; the old curve later became MD 856. MD 298 was extended to its present southern terminus when MD 20 bypassed Fairlee in 1953.<ref name="logbook 1p61"/>

The first eastward extension of MD 298 was when the highway from MD 292 to MD 566 was constructed as a gravel road in 1951 and 1952.<ref name="logbook 1p61"/> The portion from MD 566 to US 213 was constructed around 1946 as part of MD 566, which was widened to {{convert|20|ft|m}} starting in 1953.<ref name="1946 src report"/><ref name="1954 src report"/> MD 298 was extended east to US 213 along part of MD 566 in 1963 to form a continuous route between MD 20 at Fairlee and US 213 at Harmony Corner.<ref name="memo 1962-11-29"/><ref name="1963 map"/> That extension was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1970.<ref name="logbook 3p74"/> MD 298 was extension south from MD 213 over Browntown Road, Old Morgnec Road, and Cherry Lane to MD 291 in 1988 after those highways were transferred from county to state maintenance in a December 1, 1987, road transfer agreement.<ref name="memo 1988-01-19"/>
