not notable, at all -- no independent sources writing about this minor director of unreleased short documentaries. plus it's an orphan article. i suspect it's a promotional entry created by sock puppet.

*'''Keep''', I disagree about the lack of independent sources. There are links to articles on the wiki page, including legitimate award wins verified with newspaper articles and imdb. I've also found some of his work on Amazon.com, so he does have some films that are released and available on the market.

*'''Delete'''. Very minor filmmaker. Certainly has not received coverage in reliable sources. Awards won are minor. Refs are weak and spammy. [[User:Christopher Connor|Christopher Connor]] ([[User talk:Christopher Connor|talk]]) 19:38, 9 July 2010 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''.  I can't fit this into any of the criteria at [[WP:BIO]] without stretching considerably.  Awards are not enough; they have to be well-recognized ones, such as an oscar.  He has made films and they have been published, it seems, but they are far from prolific and I can't see much citation of them.

*'''Delete''' No evidacne awards are notable. No hits on google news (he's that noted a director no one cares).[[User:Slatersteven|Slatersteven]] ([[User talk:Slatersteven|talk]]) 18:20, 18 July 2010 (UTC)
