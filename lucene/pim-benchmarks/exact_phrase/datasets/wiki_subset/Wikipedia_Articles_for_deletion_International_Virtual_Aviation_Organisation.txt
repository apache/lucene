This is a procedural nomination, that should not be counted as an opinion one way or the other.  This article was deleted by {{admin|Eagle 101}} on [[2006-10-04]] for being "spam" after {{user|OBILI}} had tagged it with {{tl|db-club}}.  The speedy deletion was contested at [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Virtual Air Traffic Flight Simulation Network]].  Given the contest, and the fact that the speedy deletion was only 2 days after the new speedy deletion criterion for blatant advertising (#G11) was first introduced, it seems prudent to send this through AFD. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:13, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as not-notable. Doesn't seem speediable though since it claims notability (50,000 members or whatever) and the advertising doesn't seem that blatant to me. That said, I can't find any evidence that anyone besides people who play flight sims would care about this. [[User:Recury|Recury]] 17:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Very notable within it's own field. While I agree that the article needs a good re-write to comply with [[WP:NPOV]] (heck, a general cleanup would be good), that is not a valid reason for deletion (nor is lack of notability in itself), and the problem could probably be best solved with some cleanup tags; there's a lot in the article that could be re-used. See also discussion at [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Virtual_Air_Traffic_Flight_Simulation_Network]]; much of that could also apply to IVAO. --[[User:Scott Wilson|Scott Wilson]] 19:41, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Weak delete''' pending evidence of notability.  I agree that the article isn't speediable and isn't blatantly promotional.  Google shows lots of hits, but in the first five pages of listings I saw zero media coverage except flight-sim niche sites (I'm not sure any pass the reliable-sources guidelines except as supporting material) and Wikipedia mirrors.  By that fifth screen there were things like one guy's user information.  It's obvious that this is a group active in a number of nations, and there seems to be only one other group (VATSIM) of similar importance within the field, but I'd have to see some independent non-niche coverage before it meets [[WP:V]].  All the article's links are to the group's regional orgs, none to third-party coverage.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 23:59, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
:*The revision done since my 12-Oct vote improves NPOV, but there still are no independent sources cited.  No change of vote yet although the group is probably notable enough to be included.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 13:27, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Although it should be re-written, the article is worth keeping. IVAO was founded in 1998, it is one of the largest organization of this kind, has an international user base and it is a legally existing organisation (NPO). [[User:Yrtgm|Yrtgm]] 19:57, 13 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible '''[[Wikipedia:Single purpose account|single purpose account]]''': [[User:Yrtgm|Yrtgm]] ([[User talk:Yrtgm|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yrtgm|contribs]]) {{{2|}}} has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>.
*'''Keep''' What YRTGM said. Also there is a precedent as the VATSIM article was not deleted, yet it's a very similar organisation. I believe both articles have a place on wiki [[User:Babotika|Babotika]] 20:41, 13 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible '''[[Wikipedia:Single purpose account|single purpose account]]''': [[User:Canwolf|Canwolf]] ([[User talk:Canwolf|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Canwolf|contribs]]) {{{2|}}} has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>
*'''Keep''' Article needs to be brought to a more encyclopedic style, and it would be good to have some external references, but all in all, it is notable enough to keep. - [[User:Canwolf|Canwolf]] 21:13, 13 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible '''[[Wikipedia:Single purpose account|single purpose account]]''': [[User:Babotika|Babotika]] ([[User talk:Babotika|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Babotika|contribs]]) {{{2|}}} has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>
*'''Keep''' IVAO is relevant within online flight simulation. However, the field itself is rather not-notable, which explains the lack of media coverage outside the flight sim niche. Besides, I wouldn't consider Googles [[PageRank|ranking algorithm]] as a good indication of relevance for any site. --[[User:Mdomig|airborne]] 22:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
** Following [[User:Scott Wilson|Scott Wilsons]] idea, I just proposed a cleaned-up edit which should be [[WP:NPOV]] compatible. Feel free to revert. --[[User:Mdomig|airborne]] 08:20, 14 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' IVAO is the 2nd largest organisation in online flight simulation. Mainly because of what said by [[User:Mdomig|airborne]], [[User:Babotika|Babotika]] and [[User:Yrtgm|Yrtgm]]. [[User:TheSpecialist|TheSpecial]] 08:54, 14 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' I do agree with opinion stated above, no much more to say [[User:Yownos|Yownos]] 19:54, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' but with extensive rewriting. -- [[User:Airodyssey|AirOdyssey]] ([[User talk:Airodyssey|Talk]]) 22:00, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Delete''' per [[WP:SPEEDY#G4|CSD G4]] [[User:TV Newser|TV Newser]] [[User talk:TV Newser|Tipline]] 03:29, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Query:''' When was it previously deleted? --[[User:Scott Wilson|Scott Wilson]] 13:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
:*The prior deletion was speedy, so I don't see the relevance of [[WP:SPEEDY#G4|CSD G4]]. [[User:Tkrajcar|Tim]] 14:37, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
::*That's what I thought. I'm just wondering if I've missed something else. I only happened across this AfD by accident after some poring over the deletion logs. --[[User:Scott Wilson|Scott Wilson]] 15:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Delete''' I thought we got rid of this gamer garbage and it pops up again, but the stupid gamers come and recreate it against the rules. [[User:OBILI|OBILI]] [[User talk:OBILI|®]] [[Special:Contributions/OBILI|±]] 14:55, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' Take a look at the deletion logs.  It was restored to go onto AfD (it has ''not'' been recreated).  G4 technically only applies if it was deleted through an XfD process.  (Also, calling things you don't like "garbage" is close to [[WP:CIVIL]].) [[User:ColourBurst|ColourBurst]] 15:52, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' As above, plus I contest that [[WP:SPEEDY#G11|G11]] applies to the latest revision. --[[User:Mdomig|airborne]] 17:06, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. This has made it to a few newspapers in Turkey along with VATSIM: http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=94815 (others were printed papers). I think, it meets notability criteria. -[[User:İLevent|levent]] 17:36, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. This organization is equally notable as VATSIM, which remain on Wikipedia despite efforts to delete the page using most uncivil and intemperate tones. --[[User:LukeKolin|LukeKolin]] 20:44, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Apparently the gamer community has rallied, due to the owners of the gamer website asking people to save their ad. This is not right and yet another reason why this spam should be removed! [[User:OBILI|OBILI]] [[User talk:OBILI|®]] [[Special:Contributions/OBILI|±]] 14:57, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' Please try to remain [[WP:CIVIL]], especially when making accusations of meatpuppetry such as this. Of the ten keep votes, while two ([[Special:Contributions/Yrtgm|Yrtgm]] and [[Special:Contributions/Yownos|Yownos]]) have only edited this page, VATSIM's AfD and the IVAO article, the others have been active since at least August and at least five ([[Special:Contributions/Canwolf|Canwolf]], [[Special:Contributions/TheSpecialist|TheSpecialist]], [[Special:Contributions/Airodyssey|Airodyssey]], [[Special:Contributions/İLevent|İLevent]] and [[Special:Contributions/Scott Wilson|myself]]) are established users according to the '100-edit' rule of thumb at [[WP:SOCK]]. You'll get much farther if you try to counter the substance of users' edits, rather than trying to smear them. Kudos for putting the template up, though. This is certainly the sort of situation where meatpuppetry could happen, even if it isn't happening as much as you allege just now. --[[User:Scott Wilson|Scott Wilson]] 16:14, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' Your negative attitude and ignorance of facts is suspicious. Maybe You were one of the [[eSkyWorld]] people? [[User:Yrtgm|Yrtgm]] 21:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
::*Please see [[WP:NPA]]. [[User:OBILI|OBILI]] [[User talk:OBILI|®]] [[Special:Contributions/OBILI|±]] 16:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Wikipedia is not for promoting websites. [[User:Ponch's Disco|Ponch&#39;s Disco]] 05:19, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
:*IVAO is more than a website. It is a network of servers to simulate air traffic. -[[User:İLevent|levent]] 08:41, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' the notability requirements are guidelines, not policy. That means that, where there is a clear case for doing so, it is perfectly alright to ignore them. It seems that there is such a case here. [[User:Cynical|Cynical]] 11:27, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Cynical, not all of our guidelines can be one-size-fits-all, no harm in the retainment of this article.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&action=edit&amp;section=new Yamaguchi先生] 02:54, 22 October 2006
