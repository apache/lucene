<!-- Please don't edit anything above here. Below, briefly describe what the article is about and why you believe it should be featured. -->
:<small>''Nominator(s): [[User:Czar|Czar]] ([[User talk:Czar|talk]]) 22:16, 19 September 2014 (UFC), [[User:Tezero|Tezero]] ([[User talk:Tezero|talk]]) 22:16, 19 September 2014 (UTC)''</small>

This article is about the 2012 video game Sleeping Dogs. I have made my absolute goal to take this page to FA, and alongside Tezero and Czar, I think I'm on the right track. This is the first time I nominate an article to FA seriously, so please help me. Also, the article has appeared in the main page DYK, in case anyone is interested.

Urdnext asked me if I could do a source review first, so I'm going to find and check the authenticity of some sources within the article:

*[http://www.unitedfrontgames.com/2013/01/sleeping-dogs-for-the-win/ Ref 80] is dead
:Replaced with the NeoGAF link. Though I'm not sure if it is reliable. [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 23:47, 19 September 2014 (UTC)
*[http://www.filmmusicsite.com/news.cgi?go=detail&id=920 Ref 7] leads to a different domain, but could this just be me? And is Filmmusicsite.com a reliable source?
:I removed that source, and replaced it with a metacritic page. Pretty sure it's now reliable. [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 23:09, 19 September 2014 (UTC)

:::No, that's not what he's saying. The citations are basically identical, but they're instantiated more than once instead of just having one for both.

That's the main issues of the references out of the way. I know that the source review wasn't very comprehensive but I'm sure someone will come along and double check over every one. Aside from the dead ref and the liability of a couple of sources, the references look in pretty good shape. The majority of the citations are in the correct places and the article is generally broad, comprehensive and well referenced. The sources could have easily passed a GAN however since this is a FAC this ''has'' to showcase some of the best work on Wikipedia. I will leave the full copyediting/prose review tomorrow morning.

Those were most of the issues I could find with the prose in the article, however overall it does look promising. The only real concerns I could find were a few choppy sentences in the first half of the article that could use with some reconstructing! For example there were too many conjunctions ('ands') in one sentence that interrupted the flow of the prose. I know that the FAC process is harsh, but if those issues were addressed and some sentences reconstructed then this article should have no problem passing!

::::It would be if we were citing facts created by the site's authors, but [[WP:VG]]'s convention is to allow interview sources by default if they're not excessively sketchy. It's even better if you can find some kind of confirmation from the interviewee that it's real, as I was able to do for a couple in the ''[[Sonic X]]'' article (I linked to the interviewee's website, where the interviews were referenced), but this isn't always available. My guess is that it's because interviews tend to be hosted on fansites and things that wouldn't normally lie about what someone's saying, plus it's significantly more work to try to impersonate a famous person (and get away with it without the other members of your site knowing) than to just make things up and claim them as facts.

*When you link publications the first time they appear in the references, you have to be careful that doesn't catch you: you don't link Computer and Video Games in the Ivan reference (currently at #9), but then you ''do'' link it in the interview currently at #27. This probably needs audited overall to check for other problems, too; for example, you cite Gamasutra twice but link it neither time. And I think you link United Front Games every time you cite it. Really, you can choose any option: not linking publications in references, linking them on first appearance, or linking them every time. But whatever you pick, you need to do so consistently.

I haven't really looked much beyond the reference formatting, so other than these issues, I'm neutral on promotion. Although, as a matter of personal preference, I'm not very fond of either of the big nav templates at the bottom.

Collapsing those reference issues. There are certainly still things about the references that I would do differently, but that's not the standard. As noted below, use of publishers for periodicals is not necessary, but I don't see any indication that they are ''forbidden'' either, and you seem to be consistent about their use. To the extent that I had problems with referencing, I think you're good to go. Unfortunately, moving on to the body of the article, I have concerns about the prose:
*From the lead:
**"carjacking, street racing, joining a fight club and visiting a karaoke bar": Consider at least changing the order here to avoid making this an example of [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking].
:*Done. {{ping|Squeamish Ossifrage|p=}}, is it any better now? [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 20:41, 25 September 2014 (UTC)
**I'm dubious of the wikilink of "heat" to [[fugitive]]. I could probably be convinced otherwise, but this is a little close to [[WP:EASTER]] for me as it stands.
::*Heat is just the name United Front Game gave the wanted vicinity so it wouldn't be the dame as GTA. Grand Theft Auto V uses fugitive with no problems, and it's an FA. [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 14:00, 25 September 2014 (UTC)
**"Through various activities such as fights, races, and driving": The elements in a serial list like this need to be in agreement. Fighting, racing, and driving; or fights, races, and drives. I'd prefer the former. Actually, though, I'd prefer this whole sentence be reworded to be more active and to avoid the dreadful "various activities".
::*Blackmane done it. [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 20:43, 25 September 2014 (UTC)
**The sentence about United Front's development research feels out of place in the development history section. It's not, but perhaps the lack of connecting clauses is what gives that impression.
::*Blackmane done it. [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 14:00, 25 September 2014 (UTC)
**"Six months of downloadable content packs": So the content lasted six months? Or takes six months? You mean, I am sure, that it was released ''over'' six months, but that's not really what this says. Also, that's not a parallel construction when you cite the number of expansions. Is there a discrete number of DLC packs to reference here? Oh, and wikilink [[downloadable content]].
::*Blackmane done it. [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 14:00, 25 September 2014 (UTC)
**"currently" in the lead does not make me a happy reviewer. Consider saying when it was announced, or when development began, or something. Even an "as of" construction would be better.

**"Shen's health is shown by a semicircular meter on the left side of the mini-map, while another one on the right represents his face, which allows Wei to regenerate life during fighting when it is full, then empties after a short time.": This whole sentence loses me. You have real antecedent problems, I think. A semicircular meter represents his face? His face allows him to regenerate life during fighting? And then his face empties after a short time? I'm not sure how to fix this, because I'm not really certain what you're trying to convey.

**"The player respawns at hospitals when his health drains.": When it is exhausted? When his health meter is empty? When he is defeated?

====Prose comments from JimmyBlackwing====
Have to back up CR4ZE on this one. Prose is awkward right from the first sentence.
*"Sleeping Dogs is an open world, third-person action-adventure video game developed by United Front Games in conjunction with Square Enix London and released by Square Enix and Namco Bandai Games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows." — Huge run-on, broken up only by an inexplicable comma near the end. Could probably be halved in size, or split into two sentences, without loss.
:*Blackmane done it. [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 12:54, 25 September 2014 (UTC)
*The word "release" appears, in one form or another, four times in the first two sentences. And two of those instances preface unnecessary full dates, which could (and should) be shortened for readability.

A few random samples from the article body:
*"Despite campaign missions being necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain content and access certain parts of the city, players can complete them at their leisure." — Packed with redundant words and far too light on punctuation. Then it ends with the informal phrase "at their leisure". Could be reduced by more than half, and merged with the next sentence (also shortened), without loss: "Although players must complete missions to unlock content and to continue the story, they may instead wander the game's open world and participate in activities such as carjacking, street racing, joining a fight club and visiting a karaoke bar."

Given the size of this article, it's tough to say whether there'll be enough time to solve such deep prose issues.

::::{{ping|URDNEXT}} Most of the people I could recommend have been retired from Wikipedia for years. The only two I can think of aren't really viable in this case: Tezero (already a nominator) and CR4ZE (already opposing). I suppose you could ask Tezero to revamp the article, but I'd guess that he's too close to the text at this point.

====Comments by Blackmane====
Hi, as URDNEXT has mentioned above, I've received their request to run a copyedit over the article and have asked them to list a request with [[WP:GOCE]], which they've done and I've accepted. I would highly appreciate it if editing to the article is kept to a minimum and that any prose related comments be directed to my talk page. This isn't so that I'm taking ownership of the article, it's just to avoid any edit conflicts that may result in too many people trying to help. I've largely worked my way through the first few sections and am working on the Design section, which has quite a great deal to pare down. I would appreciate if a second (or even third) set of eyes have a look over the preceding sections and check them for flow, readability and sense. [[User:Blackmane|Blackmane]] ([[User talk:Blackmane|talk]]) 14:21, 26 September 2014 (UTC)
:'''Further comment''' I've pretty much gutted and rewritten the Design section, particularly the paragraph on audio design. I found a number of exceedingly close paraphrases that were closer to being blatant copyright violations in that section. It was over detailed and added little to the article except bloat. [[User:Blackmane|Blackmane]] ([[User talk:Blackmane|talk]]) 15:45, 26 September 2014 (UTC)
::{{ping|Blackmane|p=}} Sounds great. John will be doing a c/e on release/marketing and downloadable content, so if you could, please avoid making edits to those sections to avoid conflicts. [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 16:12, 26 September 2014 (UTC)

::::I'd also remark that Blackmane's copyedit of the Development section was a bit overzealous.

{{outdent}}{{ping|URDNEXT}} Please be careful when you add huge chunks of text into the article that you are asking us to check. I picked up a copyvio (might have been two) in the text you added to the development section. I think the text came from previous versions of the article, but please make sure you check in future. I'm not sure if the diffs need to be revdel'd, I might have to check with some of the copyright specialists. [[User:Blackmane|Blackmane]] ([[User talk:Blackmane|talk]]) 15:23, 28 September 2014 (UTC)

====Further prose comments from JimmyBlackwing====
Working through the article, I'm noticing a lot of crufty information and redundant words. It's melting away without much trouble. However, I just reached the plot summary, which is (no offense) quite possibly the worst I've ever seen in a VG FAC. It's an avalanche of character and organization names, interspersed with snippets of generally unnecessary plot information:
*"After Dogeyes attacks the Golden Koi, Winston retaliates with an attack on a warehouse owned by Dogeyes. Shen convinces Winston to spare Dogeyes' drug maker Siu Wah to avoid the wrath of Uncle Po, leader of the Sun On Yee. Shen destroys the warehouse and captures Siu Wah, earning the trust of the Water Street Gang."
*"As a reward for saving his life, Uncle Po promotes Shen to the rank of Red Pole, succeeding Winston as leader of the Water Street Gang. At the request of Mrs. Chu, Shen captures Johnny, who confesses that Dogeyes was behind the wedding massacre. Shen captures Dogeyes and delivers him to Mrs. Chu, who kills him."
*"When fellow Red Pole Henry 'Big Smile' Lee attempts to take over the Water Street Gang's territory, Shen resists and instead agrees to an alliance with Red Pole 'Broken Nose' Jiang. During a meeting with the other Red Poles and a hospitalised Uncle Po, Jiang nominates Po's nephew 'Two Chin' Tsao as temporary Sun On Yee leader to prevent Lee nominating himself."
It needs to be rewritten from scratch. Cut it down to 2-3 paragraphs; eliminate all character and organization names non-essential to the ''thinnest, most straightforward'' description of the story. Leave character introductions for the "Setting and characters" section. And, if possible, introduce citations—they're standard issue for VG FAs. [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 22:27, 28 September 2014 (UTC)
:Plot citations aren't necessary for Plot sections of anything - if you're disputing any details, though, I suppose some could be provided. [[User:Tezero|Tezero]] ([[User talk:Tezero|talk]]) 22:30, 28 September 2014 (UTC)
::They aren't necessary, but it's typical to include them in VG FAs—as the argument goes, a video game plot is not as easily verifiable as the plot of a book or film. Plus, video games have a limitless amount of potential events, so citations help to separate the wheat ("The game begins when...") from the chaff ("Protagonist guy beats up thug 242 and..."). That seems particularly relevant with this article. [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 22:52, 28 September 2014 (UTC)
:::In my first run through of this section, I rearranged a lot of the existing text rather than cut into it much. So instead of a scalpel, I'm going to break out my chainsaw on this. [[User:Blackmane|Blackmane]] ([[User talk:Blackmane|talk]]) 00:55, 29 September 2014 (UTC)

::*I think it's a good foundation, but it's a bit too short and vague as-is. Important characters discussed in the Setting and characters section can and should be mentioned by name in the synopsis, for example. A bit less generalization of major events in the story would give the section more weight as well. That said, it's already a big improvement in terms of intelligibility—I can actually tell what the story's about now (!)—despite the imperfections.

::::Thanks for both your comments. It's important that I get feedback from outside eyes. As I've copy edited a great deal of the material much of it becomes immediately obvious to me but may seem obscure to people who are just reading. I'll go back and spend some more time reworking it. [[User:Blackmane|Blackmane]] ([[User talk:Blackmane|talk]]) 03:35, 29 September 2014 (UTC)

I don't mean to stir the pot, but it looks ''WAY'' too short - like, not even half as long as it should be. Is it really appropriate to have what on my monitor is about a page and a half of development but not enough Plot to even know the basics of what happens? This is anti-crufting gone terribly mad. [[User:Tezero|Tezero]] ([[User talk:Tezero|talk]]) 03:37, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
:I deliberately pruned it hard to get at the core of the material. Per URDNEXT's and JimmyBlackwing's comments I've readded some detail to flesh it back out without being excessive. [[User:Blackmane|Blackmane]] ([[User talk:Blackmane|talk]]) 06:34, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
::Why does the page need to be pruned hard for the core of the material? This would be an adequate amount of coverage for, like, a ''Sly Cooper'', ''Spyro'', or '90s ''Zelda'' game, not a lengthy, fully voice-acted triple-A offering. I mean, look at our other video game FAs - heck, what about ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''? That's pretty comparable in narrative depth, right? But it goes into a much more reasonable level of detail, I think. [[User:Tezero|Tezero]] ([[User talk:Tezero|talk]]) 07:02, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
:::It needed to be pruned because it had grown into an unreadable mess. If you look at GTAV's plot section, you'll notice that organization and character names are kept to a minimum, and that plot-critical events take center stage. It's a solid, coherent and (considering the game's size) spare summary. The same cannot be said of the old Sleeping Dogs synopsis. I agree that it's currently too short, but you have to start with a firm foundation. Here, as it stands, is what needs to be done to finish the Plot section:
:::*The characters mentioned in "Setting and characters" should line up with those mentioned in Synopsis; no others should be included.
:::*Synopsis needs to be beefed up in detail ''without'' returning to name overload, and the story's core arc should be clear.
:::*Character nicknames (where necessary) should be introduced in "Setting and characters", then used without introduction in Synopsis.
:::*Likewise, all organizations ("Water St gang", "18K gang", "Lee's gang") should be defined in "Setting and characters" and never again.
:::These steps will bring boring, hard-to-read sentences ("The group leader of the Sun On Yee Triads, David Wai-Lin 'Uncle' Po, is also critically wounded in the attack but is saved by Shen.") back to life: "Uncle Po is critically wounded in the attack but is saved by Shen." If you want to use GTAV as a model, it's the clarity and succinctness—not the raw length—that should be borrowed for this article. [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 08:18, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
::::<small>Just thought I'd add that ''GTA V''{{'}}s plot was never much of a problem. It was short from the get-go. The Development section had to be split off because there was good material that was disproportionately long, and Reception got massively culled after the peer review. I think this article's scope is decent, and I agree with you that raw length is irrelevant as long as the material is succinct.

::::At this stage, I believe I am going to have to step back from the article. As it is now, I'm not copy editing it so much as actual editing the core material.

:::::Every time I come back to the article, something's changed, so I don't think it would be fair to revisit my vote yet.

Shit, what now? [[User:URDNEXT|URDNEXT]] ([[User talk:URDNEXT|talk]]) 10:01, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
:I suggest that the main editors of the article discuss what material is missing and sources to go in, as per the usual BRD. As long as the reviewers agree that it has the right sorts of material for a FAC, barring a copy edit, then you are always welcome to drop another request at WP:GOCE for a copy editor. The guild can only do copy editing when the material and sourcing is largely stable, so that the only thing we really need to do is tidy it up grammatically, spelling, flow that sort of thing. It's not really our role to dive into the main editing and I've kinda violated those guidelines (not that it's the sort of guidelines that people get sanctioned for). If you do go for another request at the guild, feel free to ping me to see if I'm available for another run at copy editing it again. Best of luck!

'''Oppose:''' At this stage, I don't think the article is prepared for FAC. Initially it seemed like prose was the main issue, and that's fixable. Unfortunately, huge content problems have emerged during the nomination, what with the messy Plot section, the thin Development section and the allegations of copyvio. I hadn't bothered to oppose officially until now, but I think CR4ZE's restated opposition and Blackmane's departure have put the final nails into this nom's coffin. I suggest that the nominators withdraw, revamp the article, do a peer review and then renominate in a few weeks.

Hell, even after czar orchestrated the merging of a bunch of pages I'd created, several of them GAs, I'm still here, as is he after what looks like the first serious prose-related oppose votes on one of his FACs and me tearing apart one of his GANs on clarity concerns - and not only are we not biting at each other's heels; we're both co-nominators here.
