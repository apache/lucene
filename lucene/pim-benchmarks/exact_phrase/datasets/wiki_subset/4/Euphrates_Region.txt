'''Euphrates Region''', formerly Kobanî Canton, ({{lang-ku|Herêma Firatê}}, {{lang-ar|إقليم الفرات}}, {{lang-syc|ܦܢܝܬܐ ܕܦܪܬ|translit=Ponyotho d'Prat}}), is the central of [[Cantons of Rojava|three original regions]] of the [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]], comprising [[Ayn al-Arab District]] of the [[Aleppo Governorate]], [[Tell Abyad District]] of the [[Raqqa Governorate]], and the westernmost tip of the [[Ras al-Ayn Subdistrict]] of the [[Ras al-Ayn District]] of [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]]. Euphrates Region unilaterally declared autonomy in January 2014 and since ''de facto'' is under direct democratic government in line with the polyethnic [[Constitution of Rojava]].

The region has two subordinate cantons, the '''Kobani canton''' consisting of the [[Sarin]] area (with the [[al-Jalabiya district]] subordinate to it) and the Kobani area (with the [[Şêran]] and the [[Qenaya Subdistrict]]s subordinate to it), as well as the '''Tel Abyad canton''' (with the [[Ayn Issa Subdistrict|Ain Issa]] and [[Suluk Subdistrict]]s subordinate to it).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.hawarnews.com/euphrates-region-within-the-administrative-division/|title=Euphrates region within the administrative division|publisher=Hawar News |date=15 August 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818030323/http://en.hawarnews.com/euphrates-region-within-the-administrative-division/ |archivedate=18 August 2017 }}</ref> The northeast of the region, including [[Tell Abyad]] and [[Suluk, Syria|Suluk]], has been under the [[Turkish occupation of northern Syria]] since October 2019.

==Demographics==
 	
The current population of Euphrates Region is unknown due to substantial refugee movements, but that of Kobane Canton alone before 2014 was estimated at roughly 400,000, with an ethnic [[Kurds in Syria|Kurdish]] majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/17072014|title=Kobane Under Intense ISIS Attack, Excluded from UN Humanitarian Aid|work=Rudaw|date=17 July 2014}}</ref> Due to intense fighting at least three-quarters of the population fled across the [[Syrian-Turkish border|border to Turkey]] in 2014;<ref name=military_support>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Oct-22/274938-syria-says-giving-military-support-to-kurds-in-koban.ashx#axzz3GNeXxGTV|title=Syria says giving military support to Kurds in Kobani|newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]]|date=October 22, 2014|accessdate=October 14, 2014|agency = [[Agence France-Presse]]}}</ref> however, many returned in 2015.<ref name=rebuild1>{{cite web|title=The dangerous rebuilding of Kobani|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/18/kobani-rebuilding/}}</ref>
 	
Cities and towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants according to the 2004 Syrian census are [[Kobanî]] (44,821).

==History==
{{see also|Rojava conflict}}
{{further information|Siege of Kobanî|Tell Abyad offensive}}

The present Kurdish-populated area on the left bank of the [[Euphrates]] was settled by Kurdish tribes at the beginning of the 17th century.<ref name="Tejel2008">{{cite book|author=Jordi Tejel|title=Syria's Kurds: History, Politics and Society|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-09643-5|pages=10–}}</ref> In modern post-independence Syria, the Kurdish population of the region was subject to heavy-handed [[Arabization]] policies by the Damascus government.<ref>{{cite web|title=SYRIA: The Silenced Kurds; Vol. 8, No. 4(E)|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Syria.htm|website=Human Rights Watch|date=1996}}</ref> In the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]] and the [[Rojava conflict]], [[Syrian government]] forces withdrew from the area, and on 27 January 2014 an autonomous [[Kobanî Canton]] under the [[Constitution of Rojava]] was declared and institutions established.

In July 2013, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) began to forcibly displace Kurdish civilians from towns in [[Raqqa Governorate]]. After demanding that all [[Kurds]] leave [[Tell Abyad]] or else be killed, thousands of civilians, including [[Turkmens]] and Arabs, fled on 21 July. ISIL fighters looted and destroyed the property of Kurds, and in some cases, resettled displaced [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Arab]] families from the [[an-Nabek District]] (Rif Damascus), [[Deir ez-Zor]] and [[Raqqa]], in abandoned Kurdish homes. A similar pattern was documented in [[Tel Arab]] and [[Tal Hassel]] in July 2013. As ISIL consolidated its authority in Raqqa, Kurdish civilians were forcibly displaced from [[Tel Akhader]], and from the immediate [[Kobanî]] area, in March and September 2014, respectively.<ref name="ohchr.org">{{cite web|title=Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic: Twenty-seventh session|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/HRC_CRP_ISIS_14Nov2014.doc|website=UN Human Rights Council}}</ref>

==Politics and administration==
{{See also|Constitution of Rojava|List of political parties in Rojava}}

Kobanî's Legislative Assembly has two co-presidents, [[Lemis Abdullah]] (an [[Armenians in Syria|Armenian]] woman refugee from [[Tell Abyad]]), and [[Mihemed Şahin]] (a [[Kurd]]ish man).<ref>https://anfenglishmobile.com/rojava-syria/armenian-woman-at-the-head-of-the-euphrates-region-administration-41559</ref> According to the constitutional Charter of the Social Contract, the Kobanî Canton's Legislative Assembly  declared autonomy at its 27 January 2014 session.

==Economy==
{{see also|Economy of Syria|Rojava#Economy}}

The economy of the region is mainly based on agriculture, with the introduction of [[greenhouse]] agriculture since the establishment of the Euphrates Region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukssd.de/preparations-for-agricultural-project-in-jotkar-kobani-syria/|title=Preparations for “Jotkar” agricultural project|work=UKSSD e. V.|date=11 February 2016|accessdate=2016-12-07}}</ref>

While there is no significant industrial area in the Euphrates Region, there is a large number of cement production facilities.<ref name="branches" />

Some electricity is supplied by the [[Tishrin Dam]] on the [[Euphrates]], also in the Euphrates Region; a lot is also produced by diesel generators.<ref name="branches">{{cite web|url=https://cooperativeeconomy.info/rojava-the-economic-branches-in-detail/|title=Rojava: The Economic Branches in Detail|work=cooperativeeconomy.info|date=14 January 2017|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728225813/https://cooperativeeconomy.info/rojava-the-economic-branches-in-detail/|archive-date=28 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Around the region, but in particular in the city of Kobanî, economic priorities are the continuing war and reconstruction, including help for returning refugees.<ref name=rebuild1 /> Most of the city and surrounding villages have been destroyed or badly damaged, and there is a danger of landmines.<ref name=rebuild1 /> As of January 2017, in spite off the paucity of resources available and the embargoes imposed on the region, the rebuilding process has made considerable progress; over 70% of damaged roads have been restored, two hospitals rebuilt and another two added, and the 15 schools rebuilt now host over 50,000 students.<ref name="raising">{{cite web|url=http://realmedia.press/raising-kobani-rubble/|title=Raising Kobanî from Rubble|author=Manisha Ganguly|publisher=realmedia.press|date=14 January 2017|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>

== Education ==
{{See also|Education in Syria|Rojava#Education, media, culture}}

Like in the other regions in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, primary education in public schools is initially instructed according to each student's mother tongue, be it Kurdish or Arabic. Students then begin to learn their second language of Kurdish or Arabic, as well as additional instruction of English. This is due to Rojava's stated goal of students achieving [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] in both Kurdish and Arabic by secondary schooling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anfenglish.com/culture/education-in-rojava-after-the-revolution|title=Education in Rojava after the revolution|publisher=ANF|date=2016-05-16|accessdate=2016-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/11/syria-kurdistan-self-governance-teach-kurdish-language.html|title=After 52-year ban, Syrian Kurds now taught Kurdish in schools|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=2015-11-06|accessdate=2016-05-18}}</ref> Curricula are a topic of continuous debate between the regions' Boards of Education and the Syrian central government in Damascus, which partly pays the teachers.<ref name=syriaclanguage>{{cite web|url=http://syrianobserver.com/EN/News/31729/Hassakeh_Syriac_Language_Be_Taught_PYD_controlled_Schools/|title=Hassakeh: Syriac Language to Be Taught in PYD-controlled Schools|publisher=The Syrian Observer|date=3 October 2016|accessdate=2016-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2015/10/kurds-introduce-own-curriculum-at-schools-of-rojava-2/|title=Kurds introduce own curriculum at schools of Rojava|publisher=Ara News|date=2015-10-02|accessdate=2016-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/revolutionary-education-rojava|title=Revolutionary Education in Rojava|publisher=New Compass|date=2015-02-17|accessdate=2016-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kurdishquestion.com/oldsite/index.php/kurdistan/west-kurdistan/education-system-in-rojava/538-education-system-in-rojava.html/|title=Education in Rojava: Academy and Pluralistic versus University and Monisma|publisher=Kurdishquestion|date=2014-01-12|accessdate=2016-05-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510103830/http://kurdishquestion.com/oldsite/index.php/kurdistan/west-kurdistan/education-system-in-rojava/538-education-system-in-rojava.html/|archive-date=2016-05-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> With Euphrates Region being home to a [[Syrian Turkmen]] minority, school education bilingual in Turkish and Arabic has also been made available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kurdiscat.blogspot.de/2016/10/confederalisme-democratic-noves-classes.html|title=Confederalisme democràtic: Noves classes en llengua turcmana al nord de Síria|work=KurdisCat|date=25 October 2016|accessdate=2016-10-29}}</ref>

The federal, regional and local administrations in Rojava put much emphasis on promoting libraries and educational centers, to facilitate learning and social and artistic activities. One cited example is the May 2016 established ''Rodî û Perwîn Library'' in [[Kobani]].<ref name=k24education>{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/dfa4b335-fe1c-4a3c-b5b6-7bc5848e9e97/Kurds-establish-university-in-Rojava-amid-Syrian-instability|title=Kurds establish university in Rojava amid Syrian instability|publisher=Kurdistan24|date=2016-07-07|accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref>
