'''The Cuomo Mag''' is a 3D printed  [[AR-15]] semi automatic rifle [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]] named after the Governor of New York, [[Andrew Cuomo]], who signed the [[NY SAFE Act]] into law banning magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=FAB1>{{cite web|last=Branson|first=Michael|title=Defense Distributed Releases Printable AK Magazine|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/04/08/defense-distributed-releases-printable-ak-magazine/|accessdate=April 12, 2013|journal=The Firearm Blog|date=April 8, 2013}}.

==Initial prototype and final product==
The magazine was created with the [[Objet Geometries|Objet]] Connex26 with VeroClear (a transparent material) so the rounds and feeding action could be observed.<ref name=excuomo>[http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/145664-3d-printed-30-round-ar-magazine-brings-us-ever-closer-to-a-fully-3d-printed-gun 3D-printed 30-round AR magazine brings us ever closer to a fully 3D-printed gun], Extreme Tech, January 14, 2014. ([https://www.webcitation.org/6SiMRYK29?url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/145664-3d-printed-30-round-ar-magazine-brings-us-ever-closer-to-a-fully-3d-printed-gun archive])</ref> It was not a success, in trials they managed to fire five rounds before the magazine failed.<ref name=excuomo/>

The main problem was feeding the gun, to solve the issue, the team added graphite to the inside of the magazine’s body, modified the catch slot, and sanded the magazine once again. The final prototype was able to handle the train to fire  50 rounds, and remained intact.<ref name=excuomo/> but Defense Distributed said that though the magazine was beginning to distort from the heat, it could last beyond 100 rounds.<ref name=excuomo/>

At the time (January 2012) prices for traditional magazines were up five times from their standard price, and it was noted that disposable 3D-printed alternatives could provide a cheaper solution for gun owners.<ref name=excuomo/>

According to Forbes and the Wired magazine the AR-15 Cuomo magazine created by Defense Distributed which fired 227+ bullets was created using a [[Stratasys]] Dimension SST 3-D printer.<ref name="archive"/><ref name=Wired5/>
