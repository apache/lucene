==History==
The settlement in [[Lubusz Land]] was first mentioned in a 1252 deed and in 1276 became the episcopal see of the [[Bishopric of Lebus|Bishops of Lebus]], who had fled from the [[House of Ascania|Ascanian]] margraves of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], and the site of a [[sanctuary]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]]. Upon the extinction of the Ascanian dynasty, the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] margrave [[Louis V, Duke of Bavaria|Louis I of Brandenburg]] during his fight against King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]] in 1325 had the church and town destroyed. The episcopal see was officially abolished in 1346.

Then part of the Brandenburgian ''[[Neumark]]'' region, the sanctuary remained a [[pilgrimage]] site until the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] margrave [[John, Margrave of Brandenburg-Küstrin|John of Brandenburg-Küstrin]] had the [[relic]] removed and the chapel was demolished by the citizens of nearby [[Ośno Lubuskie|Drossen]]. Destroyed by a blaze in 1757, Göritz and its church were rebuilt by the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] authorities; it received [[German town law|town privileges]] in 1808.
