'''Delete. '''  Was prod but dispute has arisen on day 5 so I am submitting it here. Non-notable bio, written by company publicist. Contents not-verifiable. Does not meet criteria for notability: people still alive.  At this time there is no indication it will pass the 10 test for verifiability or 100 year test notability.  A nice-looking page but not of broad interest. [[User:Nimby|Nimby]] 14:13, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

I am also nominating the following related pages.  They are (respectively) the company page and the publicist's page:
*[[Mimetic_Productions]]
*[[Karolyn_Hart]]
