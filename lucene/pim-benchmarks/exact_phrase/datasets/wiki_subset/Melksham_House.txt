'''Melksham House''' is a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II listed]] house, situated 150 metres west of the Market Place in the town of [[Melksham]], Wiltshire, England.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1285783 |desc=Melksham House |accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>

The house was built between the 17th and early 18th century, although records show a building on this site since about 1608.  In 1699 Richard Coxeter sold the property to [[Sir Walter Long, 2nd Baronet of Whaddon|Sir Walter Long]], after which time various replacements and extensions were added over the years, while the house continued in the ownership of the Long family.

During the 19th century the house had a succession of owners, including (from 1866)<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=401|title=Question: Melksham House|last=|first=|date=July 2011|website=Wiltshire Community History|publisher=Wiltshire Council|access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref> Edward Barnwell, schoolmaster, archaeologist and antiquarian, who financed the building of St Andrew's church in the Forest area of the town.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Westwood|first1=I.O.|date=January 1884|title=Biographical Notice: Edward Lowry Barnwell|url=https://journals.library.wales/view/2919943/3005913/74|journal=Archaeologia Cambrensis|series=Fifth|publisher=The National Library of Wales|pages=67-70|accessdate=2 February 2019}}</ref> After the house was bought in 1895 by Charles Awdry of [[Shaw, Wiltshire|Shaw Hill House]], the Blathwayt family were tenants<ref name=":0" /> – among them George Blathwayt, appointed [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire]] in 1916.<ref>{{London Gazette

In 1920 the house and surrounding {{convert|25|acre|ha}} was in the ownership of the [[Avon Rubber|Avon Rubber Company]], purchased for use as the company club and sports centre for the "social welfare of their employees". The formal opening of the club took place on 11 December 1920, but just days later a fire broke out destroying much of the house, and all that could be salvaged was the [[façade]] which has remained intact to this day. The damaged part of the house was rebuilt in a manner more suited to a sports club. In 1963, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] wrote that the house was "... alas so much pulled about that it cannot count any longer as a C17 building".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pevsner |first1=Nikolaus |authorlink1=Nikolaus Pevsner |last2=Cherry |first2=Bridget (revision) |year=1975 |origyear=1963 |title=Wiltshire |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |edition=2nd |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=978-0-14-0710-26-7 |page=344}}</ref>

In 1997, Avon Rubber sold its tyre interest to [[Cooper Tire & Rubber Company]] of [[Findlay, Ohio]], United States, and included in this sale was Avon's {{convert|35|acre|ha|sing=on}} manufacturing site in Melksham and the Melksham House sports and social club. The site was sold in 2011 to [[Wiltshire Council]], and is intended to become a "campus" of council and health services.<ref name="fc">{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/news/9727700.Club_is_moving_the_goalposts/|title=Club is moving the goalposts|date=26 May 2012|website=Wiltshire Times|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>

The sports ground on the southern part of the site was the home of [[Melksham Town F.C.]] from 1926, and was also used by Melksham Rugby Club.<ref name="fc" /> In January 2017, both clubs moved to new facilities at Oakfields on the eastern edge of the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/news/15015510.New_sports_club_finally_opens_its_doors_in_Melksham/|title=New sports club finally opens its doors in Melksham|last=McLean|first=Patrick|date=11 January 2017|website=Wiltshire Times|language=en|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>
