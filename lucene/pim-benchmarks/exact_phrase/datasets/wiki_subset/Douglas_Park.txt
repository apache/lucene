Hamilton ceased playing first team matches at Douglas Park at the end of the [[1993–94 in Scottish football|1993–94]] season.<ref name = "Inglis446"/> The club continued to use the stadium for [[reserve team]] matches until January 1995, as the sale of the ground was not completed until December 1994.<ref name = "Inglis446"/> Douglas Park was then redeveloped as a [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket.<ref name = "Inglis446"/> Turnstiles were sold to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and part of the main stand was sold to [[Auchinleck Talbot F.C.|Auchinleck Talbot]] for £30,000.<ref name = "Inglis446"/> The only part of the old ground that Hamilton Academical retained was the floodlights.<ref name = "Inglis446"/> A new stadium, called [[New Douglas Park]], was built immediately next to the old site.
