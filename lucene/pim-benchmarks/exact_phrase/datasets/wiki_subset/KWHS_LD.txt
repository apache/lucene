The station, which signed on the air in 1992 and maintains a studio in Colorado Springs, was previously a [[broadcast relay station#Semi-satellites|semi-satellite]] of KWHD in [[Denver]], owned by LeSEA Broadcasting (now [[Family Broadcasting Corporation]]). Both outlets shared the same programming with some exceptions. (KWHD is now [[KETD]], carrying [[Estrella TV]]; the station does still operate a subchannel carrying a schedule of religious programming that remained identical to that of KWHS until 2018.)
