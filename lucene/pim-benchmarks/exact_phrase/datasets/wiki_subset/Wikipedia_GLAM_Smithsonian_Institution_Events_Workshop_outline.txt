#What problems does Wikipedia have? 
:*What are the problems?:
::*Accuracy; updating; stability; edit wars/[[WP:OWN]]ership
::*Fairness; [[WP:COI]]
::*Poorly covered areas : History, Traditional Humanities fields
::*Uneven depth in even fairly well covered areas
::*Spam

===Navigating Wikipedia ([[Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia]])===
''10-15 minutes, mostly driven by presenter''
:*Searching 
::*Wikipedia Search box and other search engines (Wikipedia is almost always at the top of searches)

::*Wikipedia Portals of broad subjects [[Portal:Contents/Portals]]
::*Wikipedia [[Portal:Contents/Categorical index|Categories]] & [[Categories|Complete A-Z list of categories]]
::*Links in articles

*Evaluating articles
:*Compare [[John Bull (locomotive)]] and [[Smithsonian Police]]
::*Sourcing ([[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]; [[WP:RS]]); External links ([[WP:EL]])
::*Article history (active histories tend to be controversial or in the news, whereas stable articles will have more consistent supervision)
::*Talk page - Wikiprojects rate their own articles; discussion of article improvement
:::*Quality and priority designations ([[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment]])
:::*Problem designations: Cleanup, PovCheck, Unreferenced, Tone, Advert, Disputed, Update

*[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Smithsonian Institution]]

===Getting started===
30 minutes with some click through and with users doing hands-on edits. This section should be demonstrated by the presenter while workshop participants walk through the edits. Wikipedians not presenting should help the workshop participants if they fall behind or have problems making edits.

;Log in to your User Account
:Go to your User page
:Add some personal information (see [[WP:COI]]) (From [[Wikipedia:GLAM/Smithsonian Institution/Copy]])
:: Note the standard five steps: open a page (or section) for editing, make editing changes, add an edit summary, preview [and repeat second and fourth steps if needed], and save.

Add user preferences by going to [[Special:Preferences]] and going to the gadgets bar, there add the following:
:;Under "Editing gadgets"
#:HotCat
#:[RefTools
:;Under "User interface gadgets"
# " Display an assessment of an article's quality as part of the page header for each article"
;Create a user "sandbox" - set up [[User:WhateverName/Sandbox]] or [[User:WhateverName/Name of Article]]
*Create a sample article about the [[Smithsonian Chamber Music Society]] in their sandbox using links http://americanhistory.si.edu/events/programdetail.cfm?newskey=49 and http://americanhistory.si.edu/events/event.cfm?archive=true&key=26&eventkey=1522&date=2008-10-18
*Include the following activities during editing, making sure to leave an edit summary for each edit:
**Bold the article title 
**Use <nowiki>== Text here== </nowiki> to create a section header
**Add a citation/reference using refTools
**add <nowiki>{{reflist}}</nowiki>
**Add an image [[:File:Axelrod Quartet 4.jpg]]
**Add an external link 
**Use HotCat to add category [[:Category:Smithsonian test articles]] at the bottom of the page
**Do a preview before saving each edit
* Edit a section, rather than an entire article, once there are sections in the article.

:::''Note: it's better to do a bunch of small edits than to do one huge edit, even though that takes longer.''

;Go to one of the following Smithsonian-related stubs and make a change, in groups of two to three SI participants, with a Wikipedian watching to answer questions.
::Smithsonian users should also look at 
:* [[Leland Ossian Howard]]
