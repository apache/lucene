'''Stadio Brianteo''', known for sponsorship reasons as the '''U-Power Stadium''' since September 2020, is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Monza]], Italy, and the home of [[A.C. Monza]]. Mostly used for football matches, the stadium was built in 1988 and has a capacity of 18,568, though only 10,000 are fully operational. The stadium is also used for rugby matches, concerts and other events.

== History ==
Stadio Brianteo, located on the north-eastern outskirts of Monza, was built as a replacement for the Gino Alfonso Sada stadium, located in the center near the station. The construction works started after a long debate and lasted a long time due to the technical difficulties in the construction of the structure that supports the coverage of the grandstand and the changes to the project in progress. Initially an athletics track was planned, but it was eliminated during the works. The stadium was inaugurated on 28 August 1988 during the [[Coppa Italia]] match against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], which ended with a score of 2–1 for Monza, with goals by [[Pierluigi Casiraghi|Casiraghi]], [[Giuseppe Giannini|Giannini]], and [[Carmelo Mancuso|Mancuso]].

Since 4 September 2020, the stadium is known commercially as the U-Power Stadium for the [[2020–21 Serie B]] season.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U-Power nuovo Naming Sponsor dell’AC Monza, ecco lo U-Power Stadium! - Associazione Calcio Monza S.p.A.|url=https://www.monzacalcio.com/it/news/1950/|access-date=2020-09-04|website=www.monzacalcio.com|language=it}}</ref>
