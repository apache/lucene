{{lu|Sandybarnes/Amy schrier}}

Hello, I have put a draft on an entry for Amy Schrier in the "sandbox" or a place where it is not finalized. I hope a Wikipedia editor
can edit it and launch it as I have been unsuccessful, perhaps because I am not so familiar with how Wikipedia works.
Thank you in advance.  00:03, 8 March 2011 (UTC)  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sandybarnes|Sandybarnes]] ([[User talk:Sandybarnes|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sandybarnes|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== How to create account with same name on Commons? ==
I need to create a User account on [[Wikimedia Commons]], I already have an account here on [[English Wikipedia]], so is there a way to create an account with the same name on the Commons? The User name I want is "Hibernian", so I tried to create a new account with that on the Commons, but it says that an account with that name already exists, but I've checked the Commons and there is no [[User: Hibernian]] there. Could the Commons be referring to my account here? I've also tried logging in with my usual User name and password on the Commons, but it just doesn't work, says "wrong password". How do I create an account with my current User name on the Commons? I was told that there was some way to link the accounts but, I have no idea how to do this. --[[User:Hibernian|Hibernian]] ([[User talk:Hibernian|talk]]) 03:43, 8 March 2011 (UTC)
:The [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&user=Hibernian Commons log] shows Hibernian create an account 22 September 2007, uploaded a few files that day (subsequently deleted), and has had no activity since. —[[User:TEB728|teb728]] [[User talk:TEB728|t]] [[Special:Contributions/TEB728|c]] 04:02, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

::Ah ok, does that mean I can't create an account with that name at all? Is there no rule that an old account is deleted after a certain amount of time? I did register the name first, in November 2005 ([http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/pcount/index.php?name=Hibernian&lang=en&wiki=wikipedia]). I suppose I can just create another User name on the Commons, but it would be better if I had the same one for both. --[[User:Hibernian|Hibernian]] ([[User talk:Hibernian|talk]]) 04:10, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

Ok thanks, that's useful, but how would I go about doing this, it seems pretty complicated. Should I try to get some advice on those Talk pages? --[[User:Hibernian|Hibernian]] ([[User talk:Hibernian|talk]]) 19:29, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:http://toolserver.org/~vvv/sulutil.php?user=Hibernian shows you don't have [[Wikipedia:Unified login|unified login]] so I suggest that as your first step. It will strengthen your claim to the name Hibernian. You can get unified login at [[Special:MergeAccount]]. It will probably tell you that you don't have the password for the Commons account. Once you have unified login, create a Commons account with an arbitrary name, log in to Commons with the account and request to usurp Hibernian with the procedure at [[Commons:Commons:Changing username/Usurp requests]]. Mention that you want to complete your unified login and you intent to use the Commons account. Then you will have a better claim to the name than the current [[Commons:User:Hibernian]] but I cannot say whether your request will be granted. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 01:01, 9 March 2011 (UTC)

::Ok, I've followed your advice and created a Unified Login ([http://toolserver.org/~vvv/sulutil.php?user=Hibernian]) (though at the moment it only has my en.wiki account on it) and have created a temporary user name on Wiki Commons called [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Hibernian_temp User:Hibernian_temp]. I suppose the next step is to officially request a usurpation of the Commons account, now I just need to work out how to do that.

== Mobile version for iPod touch not working ==

Thanks for reading, The 'mobile version' of wikipedia on my iPod touch has stopped running. I've searched fairly hard, tho I'm not very advanced with these things, looking to re-install the mobile version for my device & haven't figured it out. It stopped running the mobile version a few days ago & only opens the standard wikipedia page. This same issue happened awhile back & was re-installed but it was long ago & again I can't figure it out on my own. There appears to be a way to disable the 'mobile version' when in the mobile mode, but no way to change it to the 'mobile version' when in the standard mode that i can see.     I don't know why it stopped running in the mobile version cause I know not to click on the disable button.

== Is there any guideline for the surveying of academic research for English Wikipedians ==

I have learned how to use English Wikipedia, and also am studying on the behaviors of the Wikipedians, specifically the motivation of the Wikipedians to contribute.

:Much research has already been done, so you could start by reading the article [[Academic studies about Wikipedia]] and the sources listed in the "References" and "Further reading" sections there.

::Thanks for your helpful answer. I know some researchers use Wikipedia database to be dumped. However, I need my own survey because the study is about how Wikipedians perceive some concepts and some objects on Wikipeida. Please give an advice to me. In addition, I would like to know whether or not it makes legal or communal problem to send Wikipedians survey questions via special:sending email.

Short answer - paid for editing is not allowed. [[User:Dodger67|Roger]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 18:36, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

::Actually, Roger, paid editing is actually allowed.  Two attempts at policy/guidelines concerning [[WP:Paid editing]] have failed.  [[WP:COI]] allows paid editing and conflict of interest editing as long as it is [[WP:NEUTRAL|neutral]] and properly [[WP:RS|cited]].  Jimbo banned paid editing services or admins/crats/editors offering their services for payment though.--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 22:37, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

:::Well as far as I am concerned paid editors are the baby rapists and serial killers of WP. They should be exterminated on sight. A paid editor has an inherent conflict of interest, to even suggest that a neutral paid editor could exist is insane. I'm sorry but I really feel very strongly about this. Paid editing inherently violates at least two of WP's fundamental policies: NPOV, COI - there is simply no way to get around that. It is also simply fraud as I stated above because it is impossible to guarantee delivery of the contracted product. It's only a matter of time before somebody sues a paid editor for breach of contract through failing to deliver the goods. [[User:Dodger67|Roger]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 13:37, 9 March 2011 (UTC)
::::Still, the community has not been able to come to a consensus to ban the practice.  As far as somebody being sued by their employer, that's really not Wikipedia's problem.  [[WP:AGF]] comes into practice here where [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:COI]] are concerned.  You shouldn't assume an editor is going to be inherently POV until you've seen clear evidence of it.  In addition, [[WP:COI]] says "Conflict of interest is not a reason to delete an article" and "Editors with COIs who wish to edit responsibly are strongly encouraged to follow Wikipedia policies and best practices scrupulously."  The practice is not banned or forbidden, just strongly scrutinized and discouraged.  It's not that I'm making assumptions based on a lack of addressing the issue, the issue has been addressed by the community and the consensus (or lack thereof) has been that paid editing is discouraged but not forbidden.--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 14:55, 9 March 2011 (UTC)

::The question should be more specific. Is there some [[WP:WIAA|article]] or [[Help:Contents|instruction page]] you find hard to understand? If you tell us the name of the specific page or [[Help:Section|sections]] you don't understand, perhaps we can explain it better, and maybe improve the confusing page to make it more understandable. One common problem is un[[Help:Link|linked]] jargon (see: [[Wikipedia:Build the web]]). However, as [[User:Zakhalesh|Zakhalesh]] points out, some things are inherently complex and take time and effort to learn. As Albert Einstein said, everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler. See also [[No Silver Bullet]]. We can and should try to eliminate [[accidental complexity]], but we cannot remove [[essential complexity]] without destroying value, accuracy, functionality, etc. For very complex topics, we can and should have introductory articles for the nonexpert, for example [[Special relativity]] and [[Introduction to special relativity]]. --[[User:Teratornis|Teratornis]] ([[User talk:Teratornis|talk]]) 19:48, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

== Expert Editors ==

My professor has asked me to see if there is a special program for people who are experts in a field (Particularly, he has a PhD and is an Historian).

Several times he has seen tags on historical articles saying "it is in need of a revision by an expert", and he is interested in how to participate, if he should just edit like a normal member, or if there is a special usergroup or something for experts.

He doesn't understand computers very well so he asked my help.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.68.79.64|173.68.79.64]] ([[User talk:173.68.79.64|talk]]) 22:40, 8 March 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
