/**
 * File-based {@link Directory} implementation that uses mmap for reading, and {@link
 * FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput} for writing.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: memory mapping uses up a portion of the virtual memory address space in your
 * process equal to the size of the file being mapped. Before using this class, be sure your have
 * plenty of virtual address space, e.g. by using a 64 bit JRE, or a 32 bit JRE with indexes that
 * are guaranteed to fit within the address space. On 32 bit platforms also consult {@link
 * #MMapDirectory(Path, LockFactory, long)} if you have problems with mmap failing because of
 * fragmented address space. If you get an OutOfMemoryException, it is recommended to reduce the
 * chunk size, until it works.
 *
 * <p>This class supports preloading files into physical memory upon opening. This can help improve
 * performance of searches on a cold page cache at the expense of slowing down opening an index. See
 * {@link #setPreload(BiPredicate)} for more details.
 *
 * <p>Due to <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4724038">this bug</a> in
 * Sun's JRE, MMapDirectory's {@link IndexInput#close} is unable to close the underlying OS file
 * handle. Only when GC finally collects the underlying objects, which could be quite some time
 * later, will the file handle be closed.
 *
 * <p>This will consume additional transient disk usage: on Windows, attempts to delete or overwrite
 * the files will result in an exception; on other platforms, which typically have a &quot;delete on
 * last close&quot; semantics, while such operations will succeed, the bytes are still consuming
 * space on disk. For many applications this limitation is not a problem (e.g. if you have plenty of
 * disk space, and you don't rely on overwriting files on Windows) but it's still an important
 * limitation to be aware of.
 *
 * <p>This class supplies the workaround mentioned in the bug report (see {@link #setUseUnmap}),
 * which may fail on non-Oracle/OpenJDK JVMs. It forcefully unmaps the buffer on close by using an
 * undocumented internal cleanup functionality. If {@link #UNMAP_SUPPORTED} is <code>true</code>,
 * the workaround will be automatically enabled (with no guarantees; if you discover any problems,
 * you can disable it).
 *
 * <p>On <b>Java 19</b> with {@code --enable-preview} command line setting, this class will use the
 * modern {@code MemorySegment} API which allows to safely unmap.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Accessing this class either directly or indirectly from a thread while it's
 * interrupted can close the underlying channel immediately if at the same time the thread is
 * blocked on IO. The channel will remain closed and subsequent access to {@link MMapDirectory} will
 * throw a {@link ClosedChannelException}. If your application uses either {@link
 * Thread#interrupt()} or {@link Future#cancel(boolean)} you should use the legacy {@code
 * RAFDirectory} from the Lucene {@code misc} module in favor of {@link MMapDirectory}.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If your application requires external synchronization, you should <b>not</b>
 * synchronize on the <code>MMapDirectory</code> instance as this may cause deadlock; use your own
 * (non-Lucene) objects instead.
 *
 * @see <a href="http://blog.thetaphi.de/2012/07/use-lucenes-mmapdirectory-on-64bit.html">Blog post
 *     about MMapDirectory</a>
