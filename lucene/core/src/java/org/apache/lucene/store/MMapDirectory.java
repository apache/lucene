/**
 * File-based {@link Directory} implementation that uses mmap for reading, and {@link
 * FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput} for writing.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: memory mapping uses up a portion of the virtual memory address space in your
 * process equal to the size of the file being mapped. Before using this class, be sure your have
 * plenty of virtual address space, e.g. by using a 64 bit JRE, or a 32 bit JRE with indexes that
 * are guaranteed to fit within the address space. On 32 bit platforms also consult {@link
 * #MMapDirectory(Path, LockFactory, long)} if you have problems with mmap failing because of
 * fragmented address space. If you get an {@link IOException} about mapping failed, it is
 * recommended to reduce the chunk size, until it works.
 *
 * <p>This class supports preloading files into physical memory upon opening. This can help improve
 * performance of searches on a cold page cache at the expense of slowing down opening an index. See
 * {@link #setPreload(BiPredicate)} for more details.
 *
 * <p>This class will use the modern {@link java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment} API available since
 * Java 21 which allows to safely unmap previously mmapped files after closing the {@link
 * IndexInput}s. There is no need to enable the "preview feature" of your Java version; it works out
 * of box with some compilation tricks. For more information about the foreign memory API read
 * documentation of the {@link java.lang.foreign} package.
 *
 * <p>On some platforms like Linux and MacOS X, this class will invoke the syscall {@code madvise()}
 * to advise how OS kernel should handle paging after opening a file. For this to work, Java code
 * must be able to call native code. If this is not allowed, a warning is logged. To enable native
 * access for Lucene in a modularized application, pass {@code
 * --enable-native-access=org.apache.lucene.core} to the Java command line. If Lucene is running in
 * a classpath-based application, use {@code --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED}.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Accessing this class either directly or indirectly from a thread while it's
 * interrupted can close the underlying channel immediately if at the same time the thread is
 * blocked on IO. The channel will remain closed and subsequent access to {@link MMapDirectory} will
 * throw a {@link ClosedChannelException}. If your application uses either {@link
 * Thread#interrupt()} or {@link Future#cancel(boolean)} you should use the legacy {@code
 * RAFDirectory} from the Lucene {@code misc} module in favor of {@link MMapDirectory}.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If your application requires external synchronization, you should <b>not</b>
 * synchronize on the <code>MMapDirectory</code> instance as this may cause deadlock; use your own
 * (non-Lucene) objects instead.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://blog.thetaphi.de/2012/07/use-lucenes-mmapdirectory-on-64bit.html">Blog post
 *     about MMapDirectory</a>
