 * Executor wrapper responsible for the execution of concurrent tasks. Used to parallelize search
 * across segments as well as query rewrite in some cases. Exposes a single {@link
 * #invokeAll(Collection)} method that takes a collection of {@link Callable}s and executes them
 * concurrently/ Once all tasks are submitted to the executor, it blocks and wait for all tasks to
 * be completed, and then returns a list with the obtained results. Ensures that the underlying
 * executor is only used for top-level {@link #invokeAll(Collection)} calls, and not for potential
 * {@link #invokeAll(Collection)} calls made from one of the tasks. This is to prevent deadlock with
 * certain types of pool based executors (e.g. {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor}).
