/**
 * Executor wrapper responsible for the execution of concurrent tasks. Used to parallelize search
 * across segments as well as query rewrite in some cases. Exposes a {@link #createTask(Callable)}
 * method to create tasks given a {@link Callable}, as well as the {@link #invokeAll(Collection)}
 * method to execute a set of tasks concurrently. Once all tasks are submitted to the executor, it
 * blocks and wait for all tasks to be completed, and then returns a list with the obtained results.
 * Ensures that the underlying executor is only used for top-level {@link #invokeAll(Collection)}
 * calls, and not for potential {@link #invokeAll(Collection)} calls made from one of the tasks.
 * This is to prevent deadlock with certain types of pool based executors (e.g. {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor}).
