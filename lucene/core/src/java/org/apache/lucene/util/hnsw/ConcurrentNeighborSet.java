/**
 * A concurrent set of neighbors
 *
 * <p>Neighbors are stored in a concurrent navigable set by encoding ordinal and score together in a
 * long. This means we can quickly iterate either forwards, or backwards.
 *
 * <p>The maximum connection count is loosely maintained -- meaning, we tolerate temporarily
 * exceeding the max size by a number of elements up to the number of threads performing concurrent
 * inserts, but it will always be reduced back to the cap immediately afterwards. This avoids taking
 * out a Big Lock to impose a strict cap.
