/**
 * Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph. Provides efficient approximate nearest neighbor search
 * for high dimensional vectors. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">Efficient and robust

 * paper for details.
 *
 * <p>The nomenclature is a bit different here from what's used in the paper:
 *
 * <h2>Hyperparameters</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>beamWidth</code> in {@link HnswGraphBuilder} has the same meaning as <code>efConst
 *       </code> in the paper. It is the number of nearest neighbor candidates to track while
 *       searching the graph for each newly inserted node.
 *   <li><code>maxConn</code> has the same meaning as <code>M</code> in the paper; it controls how
 *       many of the <code>efConst</code> neighbors are connected to the new node
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note: The graph may be searched by multiple threads concurrently, but updates are not
 * thread-safe. The search method optionally takes a set of "accepted nodes", which can be used to
 * exclude deleted documents.
