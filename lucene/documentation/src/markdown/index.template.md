# Apache Luceneâ„¢ ${project.version} Documentation

Lucene is a Java full-text search engine. Lucene is not a complete application, 
but rather a code library and API that can easily be used to add search capabilities
to applications.

This is the official documentation for **Apache Lucene ${project.version}**.
Additional documentation is available in the
[Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/lucene).

## Getting Started

The following section is intended as a "getting started" guide. It has three
audiences: first-time users looking to install Apache Lucene in their
application; developers looking to modify or base the applications they develop
on Lucene; and developers looking to become involved in and contribute to the
development of Lucene. The goal is to help you "get started". It does not go into great depth
on some of the conceptual or inner details of Lucene:

* [Lucene demo, its usage, and sources](demo/overview-summary.html#overview.description):
  Tutorial and walk-through of the command-line Lucene demo.
* [Introduction to Lucene's APIs](core/overview-summary.html#overview.description):
  High-level summary of the different Lucene packages. </li>
* [Analysis overview](core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/package-summary.html#package.description):
  Introduction to Lucene's analysis API.  See also the
  [TokenStream consumer workflow](core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/TokenStream.html).
