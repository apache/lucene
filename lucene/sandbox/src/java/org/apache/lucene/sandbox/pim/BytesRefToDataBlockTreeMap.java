/**
 * class BytesRefToDataBlockTreeMap
 * Writes (or reads) a (key, value) map as a binary search tree to an IndexOutput.
 * The key is a BytesRef object, and the value is a Block object, which is a reference
 * to a block of data identified by a pointer/offset.
 * This map can be used for instance to perform a binary search over a sorted list
 * of (term, postings address) pairs in a file, to find the postings of a specific term.
 * The size of each data block associated to the BytesRef object is not specified, as
 * it is assumed that each block ends where the next block starts (i.e., size =
 * nextBlock.address - currBlock.address).
 *
 * pre-condition: the Blocks ArrayList passed to the constructor should be already
 * sorted according to the Block's BytesRef object. Failure to meet this condition
 * will result in an incorrect execution and search. It is also expected that the
 * BytesRefs are unique, if the list contains duplicates, the search will return
 * the first match encountered. Finally, it is intended that the address of a block
 * also specifies where the previous data block ends, and therefore addresses should
 * be strictly increasing. The last block size is obtained by the value of member
 * 'lastBlockEndAddress' of the BlockList object passed as input to the constructor.
 *
 *
 * The BytesRef object, the offset, and the tree meda-data are encoded
 * as variable-length integers to save disk space. The tree is written to the index
 * output in pre-order. Below is an example of the encoding for a small term set
 *
 *          Sorted list of terms: Apache, Lucene, Search, Table, Term, Tree
 *
 *          Tree:                    Table:
 *
 *                   Search                 |6|Search|256|->|
 *                  /      \                |6|Lucene|64|->|
 *               Lucene    Table            |6|Apache|0|->|
 *               /        /    \            |4|Term|2048|->|
 *           Apache     Term   Tree         |5|Table|1024|->|
 *                                          |4|Tree|2176|->|
 *
 * In this table, the root term is "Search" with term size of 6, and this term points
 * to a block of data at offset 256 (in a different storage area) of size 768 bytes
 * (since the start address of the next term, "table", is 1024). The arrow symbol denotes
 * the meta-data information, which consists in a variable-size integer encoding the
 * address of the right child and whether a left child is present or not.
 * If a left child is present, this is the next node in the index as the tree is written
 * in pre-order. Note that the addresses of the data blocks are monotonically increasing
 * in the order of terms (Apache=>0, Lucene=>64, Search=>256 etc.).
 *
 * Additionally, it is possible to have "compound" nodes in the tree, which are terminal
 * nodes containing a list of BytesRef objects and their associated Block. When searching,
 * these elements are scanned linearly. Using such nodes can reduce further the size of the
 * table by limiting the amount of meta-data. The parameter to control the creation of the
 * compound nodes is "maxCompoundNodeSz" in the constructor (default = 0). When this parameter
 * is set to a value n > 0, the tree construction stops splitting the BytesRef objects into
 * independent nodes when the number is lower or equal to n, and create a compound node.
