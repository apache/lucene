/**
 * This interface is used to rollup values in {@link FacetRecorder}.
 *
 * <p>Rollup is an optimization for facets types that support hierarchy, if single document belongs
 * to at most one leaf in the hierarchy, we can first record data for the leafs, and then roll up
 * values to parent ordinals.
 *
 * <p>TODO: should we use this interface to express facets hierarchy? E.g. add getAllDimOrds method
 * and use it to implement {@link org.apache.lucene.facet.Facets#getAllDims(int)}. It might be
 * better to have a separate interface for it, as it probably need more methods that are not
 * required during collection. At the same time, we never need rollup unless there is hierarchy, so
 * it might make sense to merge the two interfaces?
