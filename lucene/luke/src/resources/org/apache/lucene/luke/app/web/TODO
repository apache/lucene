* Overview:
  path
  num fields, docs, terms
  num deletions, num segments
  index version
  index format(?) codec(?)
  Directory
  commit point
  user data?
** list of fields
for each field show
  name, term count, %? % docs with terms from field?
  what about other type info, eg it could be a docvalues or other type
  what about size on disk?
*** when selected
  show top terms
  can select terms and browse/search 
* Documents
  This has a kind of weird browse-by-term, and allows to skip to aribtrary term, and then list docs with that term
  Then within each doc it shows fields and values, and detailed type info. But doesn't such type info really belong on the 
  Overview/field list? Given that we now enforce consistency across docs.
** field/value list
for each item you can double-click and then select a "view <field type>" for a few field types -- but given each field can only 
have a single type, this isn't really needed.
** Browse by docid!
** Add Document!
** More Like This
this is also on the search page
** What is useful/unique to this screen?
(1) select a specific term from the terms dictionary
(2) for terms in a doc, see their positions, offset, and payloads
(2) see all the values for every field in a doc

** the doc-view we should consolidate with search, so there is a single doc detail view
* Search
So much things!
Several tabs for controlling search execution: Similarity, Sort, Return fields, special MLT tab
Query Parser + Analyzer (doesn't seem to be working?) I see: it spawns a separate screen where you can assemble an analyzer!
This seems like a lot to do in a GUI?
* Analysis
* Commits
see commit & segment-level info
* Logs
handle with file/stdout
